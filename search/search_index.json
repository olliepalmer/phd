However, this narrow usage belies a rich vein of concepts intrinsic to architecture and authorship. This thesis frames scripting as a critical mode of computation, performance, and design process. It does this through seven projects that explore relationships between technology, society, and the philosophical absurd. Works include films, performances, programmes and installations produced independently and collaboratively with experts from scientific and artistic fields.</p> <p>This thesis asks: how might an expanded definition of \u2018scripting\u2019 act as a critical methodology for performative architectural design?; how can this methodology mediate between, and comment on, technology and society?; and what is the relationship between scripting, authorship and agency? Computational scripting has been explored in depth by a number of practitioners and theorists; performative scripting has been examined within the context of theatre and artistic practice; this study adopts an expansive definition of scripting that embraces each of these approaches whilst simultaneously proposing scripting as a critical design methodology. Furthermore, the thesis introduces the philosophical \u2018absurd\u2019 as a framework for critiquing emergent technologies and their impact on society.</p> <p>In Chapter 1, two projects (Ant Ballet, Godot Machine) are discussed as modes of diagramming absurd theatrical scripts. The \u2018framing\u2019 of these projects provides direction for further work within the thesis. Chapter 2 introduces two dance pieces (Nybble, Scriptych) which represent scripted performances and a novel computer-scripted feedback mechanism. Both are diagrammatic modes of presenting contemporary computing mechanisms. Chapter 3 then discusses two experimental computationally-scripted absurd films exploring the practices and impact of contemporary technology companies (86400, 24fps Psycho).</p> <p>Chapter 4 introduces a film (Network / Intersect) created through a novel design process imposing strict rules on the creation of work. It concludes by naming this practice \u2018reflexive scripted design\u2019, proposing it as the thesis\u2019 main original contribution to knowledge.</p>"},{"location":"0_Front%20Matter/0.2-acknowledgements/","title":"Acknowledgements","text":"<p>It would like to thank the many people who have, directly or indirectly, supported my work over the past few years.</p> <p>Firstly, to my supervisors, Professor Stephen Gage and Professor Peg Rawes, both of whom have taken my research in wildly different directions, enriching and informing the way that I work. I owe much of the way I see the world (and make objects in it) to Stephen, and I consider myself fortunate to have been one of his students for longer than most. At the same time, this thesis would not be where it is without the compassionate, rigorous, and always enjoyable conversations with Peg, who has gone above and beyond the call of duty to nurture this work. I am truly grateful.</p> <p>The Bartlett has been a wonderful place to inhabit for the past eight years. I would like to thank the PhD faculty who work so hard to make it such a vibrant, inspiring, and intellectually rich environment \u2013\u00a0especially to Professor Jonathan Hill, Dr Barbara Penner, and Dr Penelope Haralambidou.</p> <p>I would not have been able to produce this thesis, or the project featured in chapter two, without the Arts and Humanities Research Council: long may they support experimental practice.</p> <p>A great deal of this work comes from a period spent at the Palais de Tokyo.

Historically, it contains numerous meanings and implications central to architectural practice and methods, but today it is most commonly associated with a particular subset of computational design. This narrow definition belies the wealth of ideas that 'script' encompasses. This thesis presents my use of scripts as a mode of critical design research in examining a range of issues related to contemporary technology. Embracing the philosophy of the absurd, it examines a range of my design projects which each use different scripted methodologies, resulting in the creation of films, installations, computational code and performances.</p> <p>The thesis consists of four chapters, an introduction and a conclusion. Each chapter presents a project, or pair of projects, which exemplify a different aspect of my practice, and mode of scripting. These range from behavioural scripts, to computational scripts, performance scripts, and finally, script as a mode of instruction in a design process. The thesis contains two direct contributions to knowledge. The first is a novel mode of physically navigating a three-dimensional vector database via a human-machine interface, which is described in chapter 2. The second is a novel design methodology, called \u2018Reflexive Scripted Design\u2019, which was used to produce a film in chapter 4. The overall aim of this thesis is to reframe the term script within architectural discourse; to open the term up to debate, and embrace the numerous complimentary and contradictory ideas it contains. Reflexive Scripted Design is the most material manifestation of this aim.</p> <p>This introduction will outline the theoretical and methodological basis for the thesis. The first part provides an overview of the contextual framework for the research. It begins by examining the development of the term script in computational, architectural, psychological and literary disciplines, aiming to reveal the varied, yet interrelated, semantic and functional uses of the term within these different fields. The chapter then goes on to outline three definitions of the term script, which will form the core methodology for production of works described in this thesis \u2013 computational script, performance script, and reflexive scripted design \u2013 with a brief explanation of where each type can be found. This section will conclude with an analysis of another related field of research that is integral to the thesis: technology and the philosophical absurd. The next section details the design methodology underpinning the work, beginning with the description of two key ideas \u2013 the absurd machine and the diagram \u2013 before moving on to a description of the modes of practice, and personal assessment criteria for design work. The introduction concludes with chapter summaries and a brief description of the works discussed.</p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch0/#contexts","title":"Contexts","text":""},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch0/#computer-scripts","title":"Computer scripts","text":"<p>The term \u2018scripting\u2019 in computation derives from its directive function. As a 1962 Fortran<sup>1</sup> computer programming manual explains: \u2018A programme for a computer is like a set of instructions for a clerk who is running a desk calculator. We can tell the calculator clerk what to do with some numbers without saying what the particular numbers are.\u2019<sup>2</sup> As this quotation implies, programming in computing involves the production of routine, procedural instructions based on binary logic. The actions of the computer are dependent on the legibility of specific symbols, usually inconsistent or incompatible with human language conventions. As a mode of programming, scripting is predicated on this idiosyncratic binary process, yet its function and modus operandi is distinct from programming in terms of its legibility and its dependency on a pre-existing language. As Ousterhout argued in 1998:</p> <p>Scripting languages are designed for different tasks than are system programming languages, and this leads to fundamental differences in the languages. System programming languages were designed for building data structures and algorithms from scratch, starting from the most primitive computer elements such as words of memory. In contrast, scripting languages are designed for gluing: They assume the existence of a set of powerful components and are intended primarily for connecting components. System programming languages are strongly typed to help manage complexity, while scripting languages are typeless to simplify connections among components and provide rapid application development. Scripting languages and system programming languages are complementary, and most major computing platforms since the 1960s have included both kinds of languages.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>Where programming languages employ a low level of abstraction from the computer\u2019s instruction set, scripting languages are much more abstracted.<sup>4</sup> This means that they are typically written in language that is easier for a non-programmer to understand; for example, there is no need for them to have to manually address memory operations. Scripting languages are useful for a variety of repetitive functions, such as renaming files, and often make use of conditional devices such as: if and for statements, clear binary logic, and rules. Ousterhout calls scripting languages \u2018glue languages or system integration languages.\u2019<sup>5</sup> Put simply, most tasks that a computer script performs could be performed by a human, given enough time (an idea explored with the project Nybble, described in Chapter 2).</p> <p>Written at the height of the dot-com bubble, Ousterhout\u2019s predictions that the increased prevalence of \u2018gluing tasks\u2019 would make scripting \u2018an increasingly important programming paradigm in the next century\u2019 have been largely proven correct.<sup>6</sup> Several of the main languages used in contemporary web programming, such as Python (the language the original Google crawler was written in), Perl, Ruby and JavaScript are scripting languages, and use libraries of pre-existing code to speed up programmers\u2019 ability to implement functions and build higher-level programming.<sup>7</sup> Google\u2019s TensorFlow \u2013 an open source machine-learning toolkit \u2013 is controlled via Python.<sup>8</sup> As Autodesk (commercial CAD software company) product manager McCullough said: \u2018No need to learn how to link headers or throw exceptions. This kind of code is by you, for you \u2013 and it is fun.\u2019<sup>9</sup></p> <p>The distinction made by Ousterhout positions scripting as a mediating layer between human language and pure computer-programming language; it implies that scripting is therefore removed from the original programming language, but still reliant upon it. Despite the fact that the term \u2018scripting\u2019 has been in common usage since the late-1970s, some contemporary critics \u2013 predominantly \u2018purist\u2019 programmers \u2013 dispute the validity of the distinction due to the dependency of scripting on the original programming language: programming is the essential language-form, which aims to optimise the function of a computer via the minimum amount of instructions that are necessary; whereas scripting is a derivative activity, which adapts the existing language framework to enable easier user-intervention, yet in doing so corrupts the purity of the language.<sup>10</sup></p> <p>On the one hand, the definition of \u2018script\u2019 implied here \u2013 as a subordinate and derivative \u2013 deviates substantially from the etymological associations of the word \u2018script\u2019 with its Latin root scribere: \u2018to scratch, engrave, draw\u2019.<sup>11</sup> Here the term implies intentionality and has subsequently become connected with the concept of one\u2019s own script, or handwriting, which bears an intimate connection to the person who wrote it, which clearly deviates from the idea of computational scripting as inauthentic. This would imply that programming is in fact closer to the common interpretation of the word scripting. Yet it could also be argued that computational \u2018scripting\u2019 is closer to the etymological root of the word than \u2018programming\u2019, by virtue of its inauthenticity. To write, or script, is not to create the language, necessarily, but rather to assemble, arrange, copy and repeat its elements in order to communicate an idea to the reader. The \u2018scribe\u2019, for example is \u2018one whose business is writing\u2019, and historically has been charged with \u2018interpreting\u2019 or \u2018transcribing\u2019 existing words, speech and language.<sup>12</sup> In Jewish history scribes were professional interpreters of the law, and in Biblical history, documenters (and upholders) of ceremonial tradition. Yet whilst associated with education and prestige, the role of the scribe also inferred a certain lack of decision-making power, as exemplified in the Bible verse Matthew 7:29: \u2018For he taught them having authority, and not as the scribes.\u2019<sup>13</sup> In computation, \u2018scripting\u2019 manipulates and transcribes a pre-existing programming language to communicate instructions to the computer and ultimately, by virtue of the \u2018copy-and-paste\u2019 approach used in scripting languages, to the user. As such, like the cultural use of the term scripting, it emphasises the act of copying and arranging more than the act of creation.</p> <p>This notion of computational scripting therefore brings up a multitude of questions regarding the issue of agency and authenticity: it is a set of instructions that the computer must follow sequentially and unquestioningly based on a binary logic;<sup>14</sup> it can draw upon pre-existing bodies of work, external sets of instructions, data sources or even programming languages; it has dependencies and requires the frame of its parent language to compile; and it can be used at multiple levels of abstraction (a script may call on another script, which may call on another, and so on). The question of authorship in computational scripting that these characteristics raise has become particularly contested in the domain of architecture, since the emergence of script-based design strategies in recent years (discussed below), where a conversation around the creative agency and responsibility of the architect has been called up for debate. Yet as in computation, the term \u2018script\u2019 in architecture embodies semantic ambiguities, due to its changing use and association throughout history.</p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch0/#scripting-in-the-architectural-context","title":"\u2018Scripting\u2019 in the architectural context","text":"<p>The earliest usage of the term script, according to Oxford English Dictionary (OED) was c.1374, in Geoffrey Chaucer\u2019s epic poem Troilus and Criseyde.<sup>15</sup> The term originates from the Old French escrit,<sup>16</sup> which is derived from the Latin base of scriptum: \u2018something drawn, a space enclosed by lines\u2019, a derivation of scribere (\u2018to scratch, engrave, draw\u2019, whereby \u2018scratching refers to engraving onto wax tablets\u2019).<sup>17</sup> Such definitions imply that scripting might be used interchangeably with the word drawing. The motion of scratching onto a wax surface, for example, implies a sense of movement, gesture and authorial intent: the movement of an individual person\u2019s hand in a deliberate manner, in the knowledge that those movements will be recorded. Similarly, \u2018a space enclosed by lines\u2019 inherently conjures the practice of pictorial representation. In this sense, the relevance of the term for architecture is obvious. However, another linked definition of the term has more ambiguous, but no less interesting resonances with architectural production: \u2018to write, to draw, or otherwise make lines, letters, figures, etc.\u2019<sup>18</sup> This definition of \u2018scripting\u2019, which equates drawing with the practice of \u2018making lines, letters, figures, etc.\u2019 arguably makes \u2018scripting\u2019 a useful word for describing the composite act of architectural design, which makes use of images, words and figures in equal measure.</p> <p>Whilst drawing is the mode of representation and communication most readily associated with architecture, in recent years architectural historians have highlighted the importance of language \u2013 the written and spoken script \u2013 as a central part of design. Adrian Forty\u2019s book Words and Buildings: A Vocabulary of Modern Architecture, examines the role that language has played in the development of modern architectural ideas.<sup>19</sup> In the chapter \u2018Language and Drawing\u2019, Forty questions the idea that the drawing is the most efficient and significant mode of communication for architects by outlining the co-dependency of drawing and language throughout the design process:</p> <p>\u2026the client tells the architect what is wanted; the architect does not only draw the building, he or she describes it, variously, to the client, to other architects, to regulatory authorities, to the contractor, to the tradesmen, to the press; and even the encounter with a work of architecture, its occupation, it itself rarely a wholly non-verbal affair (\u201cNo, that\u2019s the fire exit \u2013 the main entrance is over here\u2026\u201d).<sup>20</sup></p> <p>Forty goes on to argue that these processes are necessarily of equal significance as the written word is able to convey certain aspects of information or meaning that the drawing cannot, that are crucial to the design process, such as the communication of vague ideas like \u2018nuances, moods, atmosphere\u2019, the expression of difference, and the conveyance of meaning.<sup>21</sup> In a similar vein, Mario Carpo\u2019s books Architecture in the Age of Printing and The Alphabet and the Algorithm, trace the multifaceted means by which architecture is produced, from the writing and plans of Italian Renaissance architect Leon Battista Alberti, through the ages of mechanical printing, to the algorithms within contemporary parametric architectural design.<sup>22</sup> The focus of much of Carpo\u2019s work relates to the technological shifts in architectural design.</p> <p>Forty and Carpo are agreed on one premise: for most of history, architectural drawings, as we know them today, were not privileged as the primary design tool or communication device. Forty states: \u2018In previous periods of history, antiquity and the Middle Ages, drawings played little or no part in the production of buildings.\u2019<sup>23</sup> Carpo agrees: \u2018Before the invention of print, manual copies of drawings were famously untrustworthy, and as a result, images were seldom used, or altogether avoided.\u2019<sup>24</sup> As a result, most architectural descriptions \u2018from antiquity to the Middle Ages to the Renaissance\u2019 were \u2018verbal, not visual.\u2019<sup>25</sup> Even Leon Battista Alberti\u2019s celebrated treatise, was intended to be transcribed \u2018without any images or illustrations.\u2019<sup>26</sup> Carpo argues that one reason for the emphasis on language over drawing was the unreliability of image reproduction prior to the widespread availability of printing technology:</p> <p>Copying [^images] by hand, regardless of the motivations of the artist and his desire to remain more or less faithful to the model, is always to some extent a creative act. With few exceptions, a manual copy is executed outside the control of the author of the original design, sometimes at a great geographical or chronological distance, and with aims that may be different from those that were initially anticipated.<sup>27</sup></p> <p>Thus Carpo raises the question of authorship in relation to the act of copying (although, here with images rather than text). If images could not be stored for long periods, or copied accurately, how might they be encoded so that a copy had maximum accuracy? The answer, according to Carpo, is procedural instruction. Ptolemy, for example, used written instructions for the creation of Geography, or Cosmology.<sup>28</sup> Carpo describes Vitruvius\u2019 instructions in De Architectura as a \u2018procedural algorithm\u2019,<sup>29</sup> a set of instructions, which could be followed in exact order to recreate illustrations.<sup>30</sup> Alberti (the central actor in of much of Carpo\u2019s research) took the procedural instruction further, creating a system which enabled the digitisation of a three-dimensional structure. Within De statua, Alberti proposed using a special radial measurement device \u2018somehow inconveniently nailed to the head of the body to be scanned\u2019,<sup>31</sup> capable of taking distance measurements (presumably in two directions, with a rotational angle). The measurements would be recorded in some sort of table, which would then be used to enable the original form to be stored and reproduced in perpetuity, with no loss of quality.<sup>32</sup> The system adds a third dimension to the system already described in Alberti\u2019s famous survey of Rome, Descriptio Urbis Rom\u00e6, which contained a similar polar coordinate system with a table of numerical data to enable a reader to construct their own map of the city. This is not far from the idea of computational scripting discussed earlier, with the map\u2019s \u2018scribe\u2019 following the instructions in the \u2018script\u2019 laid out by Alberti.<sup>33</sup></p> <p>The connection between this particular mode of procedural instruction, and computerised architectural scripting, was demonstrated in a more complex manner in the work of Nicholas Negroponte at MIT in the 1960s.<sup>34</sup> Negroponte\u2019s undergraduate thesis entitled The computer simulation of perception during motion in the urban environment (1966) described a procedural programme enabling a computer to simulate moving objects, rendered in perspective.<sup>35</sup> The programme operated procedurally via dual sets of constraints: one \u2018external\u2019 set loaded onto the computer as an \u2018explicit or implicit library of information\u2019 (for example, a library may contain building codes, or construction standards), and one \u2018internal\u2019 set of constraints:<sup>36</sup></p> <p>The drawing routine possesses the flexibility to enable the designer to call for \u2018rules\u2019 of procedure. For example: \u201clines must be straight; lines are parallel or perpendicular to the 'drawing surface'; all lines meet at 90\u00ba; all rotations of the image are 90\u00ba.\u201d Such constraints allow the designer freedom to sketch 'loosely', while maintaining an accurate drawing.</p> <p>If the designer self-imposes, for example, the constraint that that \u201call lines meet at 90\u00ba\u201d, and proceeds to draw a line that meets at 80\u00ba, the computer will force the line to 'wander' into the correct position.<sup>37</sup></p> <p>This use of libraries and higher-level language to define a set of parameters within which the programme can operate is reminiscent of Ousterhout\u2019s later description of scripting languages (which would come 32 years later).<sup>38</sup> Explicit reference to scripting within a computer system, however, emerged in Craig Reynolds\u2019 1978 masters thesis (self-described as a \u2018computer system user\u2019s manual posing as a Master\u2019s thesis\u2019<sup>39</sup>) on Computer Animation in the World of Actors and Scripts.<sup>40</sup> Supervised by Negroponte (who was, by this time, the founder of the Architecture Machines Group), the thesis is rich in theatrical analogy, employing the terms \u2018actor\u2019, \u2018script\u2019, and more.<sup>41</sup> Reynolds, who would go on to win an Oscar for animation work, identified that, whilst animation requires skill, it also involves much tedium.<sup>42</sup> The solution he proposes is computer automation of the animation process. But rather than merely in-filling between keyframes, Reynolds\u2019 programme creates entire scenes based on the input of a script. A level of control is ceded to the computer \u2013 but the payoff is that the creation of scripts is easy and unintrusive: \u2018you could do it at the beach for example.\u2019<sup>43</sup></p> <p>Reynolds\u2019 thesis proposes the script as a set of parameters within which a programme can operate. It sets the boundaries and goals of the programme\u2019s operations \u2013\u00a0the script-writer merely tells the computer what they want it to do, and lets the programme work out the best way to solve it. The parameters are adjustable, but the computer ultimately makes decisions about the best way to implement the programme and create the animation. For Reynolds, the script analogy carries into much of his writing. Like a real-world theatrical performance, the performance (and the various actors and crew who will carry out the performance) are separate from the writer, director, or choreographer, to the extent that: \u2018[...] on the night of the performance the choreographer (for example) could just as well be in another city.\u2019<sup>44</sup> The script is separate from the computer carrying out its instructions, much in the way that scribes who translate Alberti\u2019s maps today are removed geographically and temporally from the script-writer. Given such vague instructions, the computer can ostensibly make decisions that affect the designed outcome. Of course, this raises questions about the role of authorship ascribed to the script-writer, the programme, its programmer, and the computer.</p> <p>Similar questions are raised by Forty in his examination of the 1960s architectural collective Archizoom, who proposed a scheme with only a verbal description. Testing a notion that \u2018architecture might be projected not in drawings at all, but entirely in words\u2019, the group laid out a description of a design that was deliberately vague:<sup>45</sup></p> <p>[...] everything will be simple, with no mysteries and nothing soul-disturbing, you know. Wonderful! Really very beautiful \u2013 very beautiful, and very large. Quite extraordinary! It will be cool there too, with an immense silence. [...] You see, there 'll be a lot of marvellous things, and yet it will look almost empty, it will be so big and so beautiful.<sup>46</sup></p> <p>The scheme, notes Forty, contains \u2018contains no particulars - no mention of what the space was for, whether 'house', 'office', 'library' or 'bar', and nothing about it physical delineation.\u2019<sup>47</sup> The description of the house, then, serves as a mode of instruction, albeit vague, for an architect to interpret. It gives similar levels of leniency to the architect as a playwright gives to a director producing a play:</p> <p>What we use, then, in creating our environment is the least physical thing in the world, namely, words. Of course, that doesn't at all mean that in postponing the physical realization of this environment, we have avoided picturing it. On the contrary, we have refused to complete a single image, our own, preferring instead that as many should be created as there are people listening to this tale, who will imagine this environment for themselves, quite beyond our control.<sup>48</sup></p> <p>This idea is similar to that of the Oulipo: where Raymond Queneau\u2019s Cent mille milliards de po\u00e8mes (which will be discussed later in this chapter) provides the framework for a number of poems too great for any one person to read, this Archizoom scheme provides an infinity of possibilities, with the design morphing each time it is interpreted by a designer. This is distinct, however, from Reynolds\u2019 software, which allowed for certain parameters (e.g. timescale, particular movements of objects) to be controlled by the designer; the Archizoom scheme fails to mention a project site, scale, budget, or any other material constraints. The Archizoom scheme is provocative, but vague; the instructional script provided to a designer provides few limits.</p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch0/#computerised-architectural-scripts","title":"Computerised architectural scripts","text":"<p>Whilst Archizoom follow vague constraints, Nicholas Negroponte\u2019s first major published work, The Architecture Machine, contains an explicit aim to change the means by which architects produce work.<sup>49</sup> Its \u2018Preface to a Preface\u2019 explains the \u2018three possible ways in which machines can assist the design process:\u2019 the first is by increasing efficiency for existing practices via automation; the second is by changing existing methods to fit machine-specifications, whereby \u2018the design process, considered as evolutionary, can be presented to a machine, also considered as evolutionary, and a mutual training, resilience and growth can be developed\u2019;<sup>50</sup> the third mode of assistance, which is the focus of Negroponte\u2019s work, is by uniting:</p> <p>[...] two dissimilar species (man and machine), two dissimilar processes (design and computation), and two intelligent systems (the architect and the architecture machine). By virtue of ascribing intelligence to an artefact or the artificial, the partnership is not one of master and slave but rather of two associates that have a potential and a desire for self-improvement.<sup>51</sup></p> <p>This \u2018Architect-Machine Symbiosis\u2019 (itself the title of chapter 001), whereby the computer is imbued with a level of \u2018intelligence\u2019, and the architect works with rather than on the machine to solve problems, is Negroponte\u2019s ultimate goal. In The Architecture Machine he describes variously using this sort of interdependent design process to model myriad systems, such as traffic prediction, forensic event analysis, 3D animation, and more.<sup>52</sup> Much of Negroponte\u2019s description mirrors Reynolds\u2019 notions of scripting as natural-language processing, which generates results that the designer then decides either to keep, or to modify via a further scripting procedure. Several of these ideas have been integrated into contemporary architectural design practice in recent years, including Building Information Modelling (BIM) software, which enables the modelling and management of multiple systems within the design and construction of buildings, giving architects real-time or near-real-time feedback on the systems they are designing.<sup>53</sup></p> <p>Parametric design processes, such as BIM, are now pervasive in architectural practice and education. Computer programmes like Grasshopper, itself a built-in extension of McNeel\u2019s Rhinoceros 3d (Rhino) design programme, provide an interface that enables the computer scripting of components\u2019 forms and relationships.<sup>54</sup> Using this interface, the designer programmes \u2018parameters\u2019 within which the computer is to solve a particular geometric problem. <sup>55</sup> In the case of Grasshopper, the interface for such programming acts as a layer on top of a standard Computer Aided Design (CAD) interface, comprising a series of nodal points, connected to each other via \u2018wires\u2019, each consisting of controls for objects and their respective connections within the 3D model.<sup>56</sup> The most basic form of such a parametric model might consist of two points in space connected via a line, with each point defined by their position on the X, Y and Z axes. By adjusting the position of sliders for each of these six parameters, the length, position and angle of the line can be manipulated. A more advanced model could then position further sets of points or lines in relation to the first pair, so that changing the parameters of the first line would cause changes to a series of subsequent lines. Complex geometric relationships can be defined with relative ease through such scripting; a few lines of code may create an assemblage with thousands of inter-related parts.</p> <p>Grasshopper is a true scripting language as described by Ousterhout, as it can make use of myriad plug-ins or libraries to extend its functionality (it is fundamentally reliant on the RhinoScript programming language for the Rhinoceros). Such libraries vary in scope: some enable programming of particular forms or solve particular problems (for example, a module that enables parametric design of standard elements) whilst others add the ability to connect microprocessors such as Arduino boards, giving Grasshopper a physical input or output. A recent library created by ElAshary and Glynn at the Bartlett School of Architecture\u2019s Interactive Architecture Lab facilitates the control of industrial robots;<sup>57</sup> Heumann\u2019s MetaHopper extension enables the parametric design of Grasshopper nodes, controlling Grasshopper via Grasshopper.<sup>58</sup></p> <p>The use of parametric design is becoming increasingly pervasive among architecture practices. Malcolm McCullough claims that there have been certain contextual factors which have increased the uptake in computer scripting as part of the design process, including the development of the programmes which enabled scripting to take place, fuelled by advances in mathematics or software, and the promotion of computers within design by educators such as John Maeda.<sup>59</sup> The practical appeal of parametric design is twofold: on the one hand, it increases productivity by embedding a form of intelligence into the architectural drawing process, facilitating faster compilation of plans through, for example, the application of standardised components and processes \u2013 as predicted by Negroponte. On the other hand, computer scripting also extends the form-generating capabilities of existing and new software, enabling the construction of buildings with unprecedented stylistic and formal properties, with architects such as Greg Lynn, Achim Menges and Patrick Schumacher, as early experimenters of the latter in the 1990s.<sup>60</sup></p> <p>This form-driven use of parametric design has gave rise to a new genre of practice in the 2000s known as \u2018Parametricism\u2019, a term coined by Patrik Schumacher in 2008.<sup>61</sup> For Schumacher, scripting presented the opportunity to revolutionise architectural practice via a holistic design process whereby architectural forms are produced by the codified manipulation of parameters, rather than the manual conception of every detail; the computer script, rather than the architect\u2019s hand, determines the formal outcome at every scale.<sup>62</sup> But Schumacher\u2019s approach extends beyond parametric design as a mere design tool; initially positioning parametricism as a successor to, and replacement for, all contemporary architectural styles, his later arguments pose the notions of parametricism as highly politicised form of free-market order which would have wide-ranging impacts on notions of public space, private property, and social housing.<sup>63</sup> In his 2009 manifesto, entitled \u2018A New Global Style\u2019, the architect argues that this scripted approach \u2018succeeds Modernism as the next long wave of systematic innovation\u2019, replacing Corbusier\u2019s \u2018rigid geometric primitives such as squares, triangles and circles\u2019 with forms are \u2018parametrically malleable, differentiate gradually (at varying rates), inflect and correlate systematically\u2019.<sup>64</sup> While Schumacher\u2019s approach is undeniably progressive in technological terms, his conception of the design potential of scripting is limited to its role as a determinant of spatial-aesthetic characteristics.</p> <p>Schumacher\u2019s comparison of Parametricism with Modernism exposes the architect\u2019s formalist concerns. Modernism is only rejected on the basis of the Corbusian veneration of the orthogonal, which is positioned as the antithesis of parametricism\u2019s pursuit of complex forms and patterns. As Schumacher argues, beyond this formal distinction, the goals of the two architectural movements are the same:</p> <p>Le Corbusier\u2019s limitation is not his insistence upon order but rather his limited conception of order in terms of classical geometry [...].[^He] realised that although \u201cnature presents itself to us as a chaos ... the spirit which animates Nature is a spirit of order\u201d. However, while his understanding of nature's order was limited by the science of his day, we now have the tools to reveal the complex order of those apparently chaotic patterns by simulating their \u201cmaterial computation\u201d.<sup>65</sup></p> <p>While, for Schumacher, the forms of modernism may be \u2018primitive\u2019 on account of a lack of scientific knowledge of natural systems at the moment of conception, the movement shared parametricism\u2019s quest for \u2018order\u2019 via the implementation of universal design principles. Indeed, the notion of a totalising design methodology forms a core tenet of parametricism, which aims to operate at all scales \u2018from architecture to interior design to large urban design. Indeed, the larger the project, the more pronounced is parametricism's superior capacity to articulate programmatic complexity.<sup>66</sup> The key differential between modernism and parametricism, according to Schumacher, is thus not architectural determinism, or what Peg Rawes has described as \u2018modernist myths of autonomy and innovation\u2019, but rather, their respective definitions of \u2018nature\u2019.<sup>67</sup> For Schumacher, the appeal of nature as the source of inspiration does not lie in its geometric simplicity (as for Corbusier), but rather in its complexity and intelligence.</p> <p>Schumacher\u2019s analogy between natural systems and artificial (computational) systems is, however, fundamentally reductive due to its emphasis on the formal (rather than relational) character of natural systems. As Rawes has noted in her critique of parametricism, Schumacher\u2019s conception of nature in purely formalist terms (organics shapes and abstracted analogies of biological systems) obfuscates the complex and contingent relationships (or \u2018ecologies\u2019) between architecture, humans and the environment, at a time when thoughtful, responsible and sustainable design is critical. The emphasis on the formal rather than the relational aspects of nature, Rawes claims, draw \u2018metaphorical alignments between digital code and biological DNA as evidence that architects have now been released from the limitations of human authorship in design processes.\u2019<sup>68</sup> Rawes argues that the removal of authorial agency (and by default, environmental and social responsibility) from the architect is reinforced by the professional and training environments within which parametricism is taught, namely \u2018through intensive workshops which focus on repetition and emulation\u2019 and by working in \u2018hermetic teams or \u201clabs\u201d\u2019 where employees rarely receive individual recognition or appropriate remuneration.<sup>69</sup> Thus, Schumacher\u2019s claims that the use of script within parametricism promotes a synergy between architectural/urban forms and the \u2018natural\u2019 (human) processes they accommodate is drastically undermined by the fact that it disregards the fundamental relational components of that system, be they social, political or environmental.</p> <p>Schumacher\u2019s limited definition, and use, of the concept of scripting in architectural design privileges abstracted computational complexity over real, socio-spatial complexity in the urban realm. This smooth, idealised version of complexity mimics, and complies with, neoliberal ideology, whereby the rhetoric of \u2018self-organisation\u2019 within the market, and the conflation of economic processes with natural systems, is key.<sup>70</sup> This relationship between parametricism and neoliberalism is not accidental, but rather, fundamental to its success. As Schumacher himself noted in 2016:</p> <p>Parametricism 2.0 makes urbanism and urban order compatible with the neo-liberal re-emergence of market processes after the demise of Modernism \u2013 the golden era of urbanism. [...] The global convergence and maturation of Parametricist design research implies that this style of urbanism is ready to go mainstream and impact the global built environment by re-establishing strong urban identities on the basis of its adaptive and evolutionary heuristics.<sup>71</sup></p> <p>While this thesis does not dispute the advantages of parametric techniques in contemporary design, whereby scripting is used as a tool in a wider design process, it does contend that the lack of authorial agency and emphasis on the autonomy of scripting as presented in Parametricism, and its attendant ideological argument, is highly problematic for three reasons: firstly, it reduces the scope of creativity in architectural practice to the purely formal, positioning the human, political and social aspects of design as elements that \u2018that divert and dissolve the innovative thrust of architectural discourse\u2019, rather than being central to it;<sup>72</sup> secondly, it eradicates the critical involvement of the designer in the most important stages of the design process, as well as other crucial agents such as the user; thirdly, and perhaps most critically for this thesis, it limits the definition of \u2018parameters\u2019 in scripting to purely abstract, form-generating constraints, that are complicit within a neoliberal worldview of self-interest and self-determination, rather than socially-engaged, real-world constraints, that force the designer to challenge and even resist the dominant socioeconomic paradigm. In other words, Parametricist design represents a very limited notion of what scripting as a generative framework in architecture could be.<sup>73</sup></p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch0/#psychological-scripts","title":"Psychological scripts","text":"<p>The relationship between agency, subjectivity, sociality and scripting has been explored more expansively in the field of psychology. Initial research in this area was triggered by the widespread interest in artificial intelligence in the 1970s, spearheaded by figures such as Marvin Minsky at MIT. In 1974, Minsky proposed a theory about the operation of knowledge structures, introducing the notion of \u2018frames\u2019 as ordering mechanisms for the mind.<sup>74</sup> He summarised the idea as:</p> <p>[...] a partial theory of thinking, combining a number of classical and modern concepts from psychology, linguistics, and AI.

Schank and Abelson explain that whilst psychologists were asking: \u2018What the is nature of all knowledge and how is this knowledge used?\u2019,<sup>78</sup> artificial intelligence researchers were asking similar questions, but with the motive of programming computers to \u2018understand and interact with the outside world\u2019.<sup>79</sup> Using this line of enquiry, the book takes sets up a framework for the application of script theory to computer programming. At around the same time (or shortly thereafter), the psychologist Sillvan Tomkins published his own version of script theory, which was rooted in psychology. Both books adopt a similar underlying premise and, remarkably, a similar title. Here I will briefly examine both.</p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch0/#sillvan-tomkins-script-theory","title":"Sillvan Tomkins\u2019 script theory","text":"<p>Tomkins research was based on the investigation of psychological affect \u2013\u00a0the study of emotions, and reactions to emotions. His use of script theory was part of a larger set of interrelated theories developed throughout his lifetime, referred to by Rae Carlson as a \u2018grand theory of personality\u2019.<sup>80</sup> Tomkins\u2019 script theory starts with a premise which:</p> <p>[...] assumes that the basic unit of analysis for understanding persons, as distinguished from human beings, is the scene and relationships between scenes, as ordered by sets of rules I have defined as scripts.</p> <p>Some scripts are innate, but most are innate and learned. The learned scripts originate in innate scripts but characteristically radically transform the simpler, innate script.<sup>81</sup></p> <p>The first witnessed innate script is the \u2018birth distress cry\u2019, stimulated, at the time, by a \u2018slap on the behind\u2019, and accompanied by a baby\u2019s \u2018flailing arms and limbs\u2019.<sup>82</sup> The second innate script is the \u2018excitement-driven visual tracking of the utterly novel face of the mother.\u2019<sup>83</sup> Babies then begin to correlate their behaviour (the actions and the responses they create) with the stimulus they are given in the world, which Tomkins calls a scene, developing sets of rules known as scripts to react to situations. An example of this is the baby experiencing hunger, and learning the appropriate response to this feeling in order to be given food.</p> <p>Throughout peoples\u2019 lives, the theory continues, they develop more rules to follow in reaction to the scenes they find themselves in. An interesting detail in Tomkins\u2019 description of scripts is their potential vagueness:</p> <p>Scripts may vary radically in their completeness of specification of rules or in their particularity or abstractness of rules, as well as in an indefinitely large number of other possible distinctive features of rules for dealing with scenes. All scripts are incomplete in varying degrees and depend on auxiliary information to particularise the script. What is distinctive about innate scripts is not the incompleteness and abstractness of their rules, but rather the imposed identity and similarity of their strict correlation between stimulus and response.<sup>84</sup></p> <p>The indistinct, non-binary nature of script rules is then useful in categorising scenes into groups called sets \u2013 for example, sets of exciting scenes, surprise scenes, distressing scenes, enraging scenes, disgusting scenes, and so on.<sup>85</sup> An individual\u2019s reaction to certain environmental stimuli may lead to the categorisation of a scene, and the triggering of a certain script in response (as is the case with such as the guilt, or shame-inducing scenes).<sup>86</sup> Scripts are activated both in response to an immediate scene (experiencing and reacting to an immediate stimulus), and dealing with sets of scenes. Co-assembled scenes, which can include real-world experience, as well as projections of future scenes, are \u2018amplified by fresh affect\u2019.<sup>87</sup> This means that, by experiencing a scene (real or imagined), the script for experiencing similar scenes may be altered. This is a mechanism Tomkins calls magnification.<sup>88</sup></p> <p>The effects of magnification and amplification come into play very early in human development. For example, babies learn to react to their experience of hunger on their first day. As well as learning a script which scripts are successful for gaining food, babies can also mis-learn behaviour that is detrimental to nutrition through the vagueness of magnification whereby the outcome, and its affect (i.e. the internal emotional reaction to a stimulus), is ascribed to one\u2019s own script \u2013 often incorrectly. Tomkins\u2019 use of scripts expands the theatrical metaphor to deal with life as a whole:</p> <p>In my script theory, the scene, a happening with a perceived beginning and end, is the basic unit of analysis. The whole connected set of scenes lived in sequence is called the plot of a life. The script, in contrast, does not deal with all the scenes or the plot of a life, but rather with the individual's rules for predicting, interpreting, responding to, and controlling a magnified set of scenes.<sup>89</sup></p> <p>This theory then enables the development of scripts that are useful (for example, a script allows us to negate the real danger of crossing the road on a daily basis), as well as causing larger-scale, longer-term, and often cyclical effects on behaviour \u2013 such as scripts resulting in addictions. Tomkins describes affect scripts which regulate \u2018control, management, and salience of affect\u2019, creating sets of rules that shape individual emotional reactions to certain stimuli. <sup>90</sup> Tomkins\u2019 formulation of scripts encompasses multiple short, and long-term effects on individual psychology, offering a mode of describing seemingly irrational rules that determine individual behaviours and ideologies.<sup>91</sup> His work on ideology, which builds on his script theory, follows a similar logic to the relationship between script and affect; the magnification of affect in response to other human beings over time leads to ideological polarisation, between the \u2018ideological humanist\u2019 (\u2018positively disposed towards human beings in his displayed affect, in his perceptions and in his cognitions\u2019) and the \u2018ideological normative\u2019 (\u2018negatively disposed towards human beings in his displayed affect, in his perceptions and in his cognitions\u2019).<sup>92</sup></p> <p>Such ideas are relevant within the context of this thesis because they pose questions about human agency and innate internal scripts. Simultaneously, Tomkins\u2019 scripts offer a mode of consciously analysing (and changing) human behaviour, through the realisation that the seemingly abstract, irrational and unforeseen forces within the human psyche are often caused by amplification mechanisms, which reinforce certain scripts, changing individuals\u2019 behaviours and emotional responses.<sup>93</sup> The concept of the irrational as a controlling force has parallels in the work of the Theatre of the Absurd (which features later in this chapter).</p> <p>Besides psychology, Tomkins also had an interest in artificial intelligence. Inspired by Norbert Weiner\u2019s early work in cybernetics,<sup>94</sup> Tomkins\u2019 attempts to design a \u2018humanoautomaton\u2019 led to writing of a 1963 book entitled Computer Simulation of Personality.<sup>95</sup> This, and research into ideology, were common grounds with Robert Abelson, who in the mid-1970s began working with artificial intelligence researcher Roger Schank on what they would come to call Script Theory; a different, but related, approach to Tomkins.<sup>96</sup></p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch0/#schank-and-abelsons-script-theory","title":"Schank and Abelson\u2019s script theory","text":"<p>In contrast to Tomkins approach, Schank and Abelson\u2019s script theory is concerned with modelling knowledge structures in relation to artificial intelligence.<sup>97</sup> The pair met in 1971 (three years before Minsky published his article citing them both) at a workshop on psychology, artificial intelligence, and linguistics.<sup>98</sup> This cross-disciplinary approach continued into their collaboration on Scripts, plans, goals and understanding, in which Schank and Abelson focus on text-based events, and describe the basis for computer programmes and modes of interpreting, understanding and predicting behaviour.<sup>99</sup> They state that certain psychologists, in asking the question about the nature of knowledge and the way it is used, \u2018have found it useful to view people as \u201cinformation processors\u201d actively trying to extract sense from the continual flow of information in the complicated world around them.\u2019<sup>100</sup> The book relates to \u2018psychological and physical events occupying the mental life of ordinary individuals, which can be understood and expressed in ordinary language.\u2019<sup>101</sup> Thus, their work can be applied to computer systems. Most of their examples take the form of short paragraphs which an \u2018ordinary\u2019 person could understand and make inferences from, but a computer would not.<sup>102</sup></p> <p>Like Tomkins, Schank and Abelson see the world as a series of discrete events called scenes. Scenes are data structures which allow for generalised inferences to be reached about likely event ordering within predictable environments. As Abelson explains: \u2018The understander is hypothesized to possess conceptual representations of stereotyped event sequences, and these scripts are activated when the understander can expect events in the sequence to occur in the text.\u2019<sup>103</sup> The primary example of a scene, referred to multiple times across Schank and Abelson\u2019s joint and individual work on the subject, is the restaurant scene. A restaurant is a highly codified space in which people have clear roles (such as waiters and patrons), and events occur in a predictable order (such as ordering, serving, eating, paying the bill). The situation requires two kinds of knowledge to navigate: general knowledge, enabling a person to \u2018understand and interpret another person\u2019s actions simply because the other person is a human being with certain standard needs who lives in a world which has certain standard methods of getting those needs fulfilled\u2019, and specific detailed knowledge, which enables the individual to \u2018do less processing and wondering about frequently experienced events.\u2019<sup>104</sup> This kind of knowledge ensures that, for example, we know to order food rather than shoes in a restaurant, or to hand an usher our ticket when asked for it in a cinema.<sup>105</sup> Thus, with fragmentary information, we can describe and imply a high level of detail:</p> <p>John went to the restaurant. He asked the waitress for coq au vin. He paid the check and left.<sup>106</sup></p> <p>In reading the above scene, the reader is able to deduce exactly what has happened, filling in much of the information based on our own collated experiences in restaurants.</p> <p>There are numerous other \u2018frequently occurring scripts\u2019 like this (the authors cite being on the street, a bus, at a birthday party, playing specific sports and going to a park, among others).<sup>107</sup> Schank and Abelson apply codification to scripts, examining dynamics of a scene, and creating what they call a \u2018giant causal chain\u2019.<sup>108</sup> The causal chain within the ordering scene of the restaurant script has 14 different actions:</p> Symbol Represents <code>S</code> waiter <code>F</code> food <code>C</code> cook <code>MTRANS</code> mental transfer, or telling <code>PTRANS</code> physical transfer, or the moving of an object or person <code>ATRANS</code> abstract transfer, or the giving of an object from someone to someone else <code>MBUILD</code> thinking (roughly speaking) Sequence of events Action <code>S MTRANS</code> signal to <code>W</code> <code>W PTRANS W</code> to table <code>S</code> asks for the menu <code>W PTRANS W</code> to menu <code>W ATRANS</code> menu to <code>W</code> <code>W PTRANS W</code> to table <code>W</code> brings the menu <code>W ATRANS</code> menu to <code>S</code> <code>S MTRANS</code> food list to mind <code>S MBUILD</code> choice of Food <code>F</code> <code>S</code> decides what to order <code>S MTRANS</code> signal to <code>W</code> <code>W PTRANS W</code> to table <code>S MTRANS</code> \"I want F\" to <code>W</code> <code>S</code> tells <code>W</code> <code>W PTRANS</code> W to <code>C</code> <code>W MTRANS (ATRANS F)</code> to <code>C</code> <code>W</code> tells <code>C</code> <code>C DO</code> (prepare <code>F</code> script) Table 1-1: Ordering scene of the restaurant script.

Abelson, \u2018Psychological Status of the Script Concept.\u2019, American Psychologist 36, no. 7 (1981): 716, doi:10.1037/0003-066X.36.7.715. <p>As exemplified in Table 1-1, this script contains Schank and Abelsons\u2019 codified actions (MTRANS / PTRANS / ATRANS / MBUILD), written in language developed by Schank called Conceptual Dependency.<sup>109</sup> One interesting feature of this language is MBUILD: described as \u2018roughly equivalent to thinking\u2019, or as simply \u2018now think\u2019, this implies a level of decision-making on behalf of the participant, rather than a total automaticity.<sup>110</sup> Abelson explains that whilst ordering food can become habituated, the MBUILD unit found in most scripts implies the individual has a level of agency.</p> <p>Scripts themselves can have variants, which are called tracks. Whilst the script contains common themes (e.g. a waiter or server in a restaurant), each track contains \u2018characteristic paths, scene selections, and props not shared by other tracks\u2019.<sup>111</sup> For example, there may be several tracks for the restaurant script: \u2018a fast-food track, a standard-restaurant track, a fancy-restaurant track\u2019, and so on.<sup>112</sup> This enables a certain level of efficiency in the storage of scripts. Abelson also describes meta-scripts, which abstract scenes at a higher level than a standard script, efficiently grouping similar activities. A visit to the doctor and the dentist are similar, yet distinct scripts; in one, a nurse may take blood pressure, and the other X-rays, but both generally involve a waiting room.<sup>113</sup> But the efficiency of the script model of knowledge can also be detrimental, leading to false recollection of memories. Bower, Black and Turner found that in factual recall of written stories, participants in experiments are subject to elaborating explicitly stated actions with the stereotypical components of scripts;<sup>114</sup> participants also tended to recall scrambled events in the \u2018canonical\u2019 (or script-normative) order. Furthermore, Garc\u00eda-Bajos and Migueles found that these false memories of events, \u2018generated by activating our prior knowledge\u2019 and subsequently elaborated with standard script-elements, have a high recall-confidence in the opinions of the subjects:<sup>115</sup> false memories generated in this manner have a high persistency (remaining consistent for at least a week) and are \u2018resistant even to explicit instructions warning against such errors.\u2019<sup>116</sup> This aspect of Schank and Abelson\u2019s script theory is perhaps one of its most interesting features.</p> <p>Scripts, in the Schank and Abelsonian sense, are fascinating knowledge structures, providing individuals with codified routines for carrying out standard social interactions. Embedded within these are moments of physical, mental or abstract (possessive) transfers, and explicit moments for decision-making.<sup>117</sup> However, the efficiency of these knowledge structures is also a potential weakness when it comes to recall of incomplete information that may be confabulated via standardised scripts.<sup>118</sup> This is perhaps similar to Marvin Minsky\u2019s concept of frames in artificial intelligence;<sup>119</sup> the frame is a more generalised, stereotyped situation that an individual can find themselves in.<sup>120</sup> The subject of frame in artificial intelligence, however, is beyond the scope of this thesis.</p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch0/#scripting-in-creative-practice","title":"Scripting in creative practice","text":"<p>The term script presents multiple potentials for agency: from the faithful scribe or computer copying without question, to the architect working within scripted parameters, to the human operating within their own scripted psychological environments, for whom scripting is both an efficient model of knowledge, but can also lead to strange affect (in the case of Tomkins, who observes a lack of rationality within human decision-making) and potential memory manipulation (as exemplified by Bower et al, and Garc\u00eda-Bajos and Migueles).<sup>121</sup> These examples imply a limitation of agency via the medium of scripting. Yet in the theatrical and literary context \u2013 a context perhaps most obviously associated with scripting, the term implies absolute freedom and creativity. This section explores the critical possibilities for the term scripting opened up within the creative literary field, through exploration of the Theatre of the Absurd, the Oulipo and Italo Calvino.</p> <p>These playwrights / movements are linked by their exploration of the \u2018absurd\u2019 as a creative framework for societal critique, which highlights and indeed perpetuates a general feeling of lack of agency among the characters in the work as a way to critique it.

Thus there is an entanglement between the form of the work, and the content. The strategies used by these absurdist writers have been inspirational in my own practice as a critique of contemporary technology. Thus their role within this thesis is to offer an alternative model of scripting (what I call \u2018reflexive scripted design\u2019, as described later in the next section on \u2018definitions\u2019), which embraces the creative potential of script, whilst also remaining critical of it.</p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch0/#theatre-of-the-absurd","title":"Theatre of the Absurd","text":"<p>The Theatre of the Absurd was a literary and theatrical genre, first identified by Martin Esslin in 1960, and described in detail in a book of the same name in 1968.<sup>122</sup> Esslin identified stylistic and thematic convergence in the plays of writers such as Samuel Beckett, Eugene Ionesco, Jean Genet, and Harold Pinter in the late-1950s and early-1960s, although the Theatre of the Absurd was never a formal \u2018school\u2019, or rooted in any one place,<sup>123</sup> and was even rejected by many writers it claimed to encompass.<sup>124</sup> Esslin traces the origins of the Theatre of the Absurd plays back to antiquity (through Shakespeare\u2019s tragicomedies, Alfred Jarry, Franz Kafka, S\u00f8ren Kirkegaard and more), yet claims that the density of works produced in the 1950s onwards and their similarities of subject matter and form \u2013 such as Eugene Ionesco\u2019s The Bald Soprano and Samuel Beckett\u2019s Waiting for Godot \u2013 heralded a new theatrical movement.<sup>125</sup></p> <p>The term \u2018absurd\u2019 has multiple meanings, all of which contain similar notions, but carry different implications. For the purposes of clarity in this thesis, I will distinguish between the two types whenever the term is written, calling them absurd<sub>a</sub> and absurd<sub>b</sub> (and occasionally absurd<sub>a+b</sub>).<sup>126</sup></p> <p>Absurd<sub>a</sub> is the more commonly-used adjective form of the word, as defined by the OED as: \u2018Out of harmony with reason or propriety; incongruous, unreasonable, illogical. In modern use esp. plainly opposed to reason, and hence, ridiculous, silly.\u2019<sup>127</sup> This can refer to both people and things; it is the illogical, ridiculous absurd. In general terms, this is the type of absurdity that can be immediately recognised in this section of Samuel Beckett\u2019s play Waiting for Godot:</p> <p>VLADIMIR: I don\u2019t understand. ESTRAGON: Use your intelligence, can\u2019t you? [^VLADIMIR uses his intelligence] VLADIMIR: I remain in the dark.<sup>128</sup></p> <p>The exchange is absurd<sub>a</sub> due to its nonsensical stage direction (directing an actor to \u2018use his intelligence\u2019). Waiting for Godot is full of the ridiculous absurd<sub>a</sub> \u2013 ludicrous logic, non-sequiturs, slapstick gags, and vaudeville stage directions. This form of absurdity is easily identifiable, with lighter philosophical implications than absurd<sub>b</sub>.</p> <p>Cut off from his religious, metaphysical and transcendental roost, man is lost; all of his actions become senseless, absurd, useless.\u2019<sup>129</sup> Esslin (and the OED) cite this definition of absurd as having originated with Albert Camus, Algerian-born French novelist, philosopher and playwright who in 1957 won the Nobel Prize for literature for \u2018his important literary production which with clear-sighted earnestness illuminated the problems of the human conscience in our times.\u2019<sup>130</sup> Camus\u2019 definition of the absurd was introduced and discussed in the four essays published collectively as The Myth of Sisyphus. The noun \u2018absurd\u2019 (referred to here as absurd<sub>b</sub>), often capitalised and prefixed with the, refers to \u2018the chaotic and purposeless nature of the universe, and the futility of human attempts to make sense of it.\u2019<sup>131</sup></p> <p>The book, Camus states, is a reaction to \u2018an absurd sensitivity that can be found widespread in the age.\u2019<sup>132</sup> At the time of publishing (1942), Camus was living in a Paris under German occupation during WWII. An avowed member of the French Resistance, it is not hard to see how his personal experience at the time might have influenced his thinking in relation to the futility of human existence. The book is written from a highly subjective point of view; in essence, Camus\u2019 absurd<sub>b</sub> is about the individual realising of the disharmonic and illogical nature of the world, and the individual human\u2019s frailty and insignificance within it.</p> <p>Camus\u2019 descriptions of the absurd<sub>b</sub> are innately theatrical and performative, and offer a rich language of spatial visualisations. A section entitled \u2018Absurd Walls\u2019 describes the metaphorical barrier between the realisation of the absurd<sub>b</sub> and peoples\u2019 everyday actions; the \u2018stage-scenery [^of the world] masked by habit\u2019 suffers a \u2018collapse\u2019.<sup>133</sup> In the first essay of the book, <sup>134</sup> Camus also writes that \u2018At any street corner the feeling of absurdity can strike any man in the face.\u2019<sup>135</sup> This absurdity can have a \u2018ridiculous beginning\u2019 \u2013 for example, when watching a man, whom he cannot hear, talking in a telephone booth, Camus argues that he is struck by the \u2018incomprehensible dumb-show: you wonder why he is alive.\u2019<sup>136</sup> The man serves to remind us that, in the same circumstance, we might well look the same, and, when seen from this abstracted point of view, our existence (and the Schank-and-Abelsonian scripts that people follow in the course of routine) merely mask the innate absurd<sub>b</sub> nature of the universe. When a catalyst rouses us from routine, our \u2018consciousness\u2019 is roused, from which:<sup>137</sup></p> <p>[...] strangeness creeps in: perceiving the world is \u2018dense\u2019, sensing to what degree a stone is foreign and irreducible to us, with what intensity nature or landscape can negate us. At the heart of all beauty lies something inhuman, and these hills, the softness of the sky, the outline of these trees at this very minute lose the illusory meaning with which we had clothed them, henceforth more remote than a lost paradise. [...] For a second we cease to understand it [^the world] because for centuries we have understood in it solely the images and designs we had attributes to it beforehand, and henceforth we lack the power to make use of that artifice.<sup>138</sup></p> <p>Devoid of the meanings and interpretations we layer upon it and perceive it through, \u2018the world evades us because it becomes itself again\u2019, leaving us with the feeling that the \u2018denseness and strangeness of the world is absurd.\u2019<sup>139</sup> This is Camusian absurdity \u2013 a sense of deep disconnect from an irrational, uncaring and dispassionate world. Plays belonging to the Theatre of the Absurd canon channel this sense of absurdity<sub>b</sub>. Many of the playwrights cited by Esslin experienced political horror or oppression directly: as previously mentioned, Albert Camus published The Myth of Sisyphus during the Nazi Occupation of Paris;<sup>140</sup> Samuel Beckett was a member of the French Resistance;<sup>141</sup> Eugene Ionesco witnessed the rise of the fascist Iron Guard in Romania;<sup>142</sup> Jean Genet spent much time in prisons throughout Europe for acts of petty theft and prostitution.<sup>143</sup> Ionesco\u2019s Rhinoceros, a play in which an entire town of people inexplicably and irreversibly turn into rhinoceroses, is clearly a direct reaction to the irrational rise of fascism he witnessed. In this sense, the plays of the absurd<sub>b</sub> are used as a mode of critiquing the societies and situations the playwrights had experienced.</p> <p>Metaphysical, and comical absurdity is used in the projects presented in this thesis as an active methodology to critique contemporary technologies which have an impact on society. Like the Theatre of the Absurd, this is manifested in two ways. The absurd<sub>b</sub>, as described by Camus, is a realisation on behalf of an individual. This means that the individual has to come to a realisation themselves, thus constructing the absurd<sub>b</sub> realisation in their own mind. However, this realisation is often triggered through use of the comic absurd<sub>a</sub>. Ionesco said of humour:</p> <p>As far as I am concerned, [...] I have never been able to understand the difference that is made between the comic and the tragic. As the comic is the intuition of the absurd, it seems to me more conducive to despair than the tragic. The comic offers no way out. I say \u201cconducive to despair\u201d, but in reality it is beyond despair or hope. [...] Humour makes us conscious, with a free lucidity, of the tragic or desultory condition of man\u2026.It is not only the critical spirit itself\u2026.but\u2026.humour is the only possibility we possess of detaching ourselves \u2013\u00a0yet only after we have surmounted, assimilated, taken cognizance of it \u2013 from out tragicomic to our human condition, the malaise of being. To become conscious of what is horrifying, and to become master of that which is horrifying\u2026.Logic reveals itself in the illogicality of the absurd of which we have become aware. Laughter alone does not respect any taboos, laughter alone inhibits the creation of anti-taboo taboos; the comic alone is capable of giving us strength to bear the tragedy of existence. The true nature of things, truth itself, can be revealed only to us by fantasy, which is more realistic than all the realisms.<sup>144</sup></p> <p>The comic, in this case, is the catalyst to the audiences\u2019 individual construction of the absurd<sub>b</sub> in their own mind. This is a similar argument to that used by cybernetician Gordon Pask in the paper A Comment, a Case History, and a Plan.<sup>145</sup> Pask argues that the mental processes involved in creating and performing a work of art are not distinct from those involved in appreciating a work of art.<sup>146</sup></p> <p>The Theatre of the Absurd is directly linked to the idea of scripting in two ways: firstly, it is a body of work rooted in theatre and theatrical scripts; and secondly, many of the characters in the plays act in ways that appear as if they do not have agency over their environment or free will, thus, their behaviours could be said to be scripted. This is seen, for example, in Ionesco\u2019s Rhinoceros, Beckett\u2019s Waiting for Godot, or the eponymous character in Camus\u2019 interpretation of The Myth of Sisyphus. <sup>147</sup> Camus argues that Sisyphus, the Greek mythological figure doomed to an eternity of pushing a rock up a hill only to witness it rolling back down again, is actually a happy figure. The realisation of the futility and mundanity of his fate is a metaphor for our own meaningless existence, and thus, freed from the burden of artifice involved in denying this, \u2018one must imagine Sisyphus happy.\u2019<sup>148</sup></p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch0/#oulipo","title":"Oulipo","text":"<p>Where the Theatre of the Absurd use literary scripts to cause audiences to consider and construct concepts of the absurd<sub>b</sub>, writers within the literary movement the Oulipo use scripted principles in the form of self-imposed instructional constraints to generate new forms of literature. The Oulipo was a literary movement that followed both chronologically and geographically from the Theatre of the Absurd. Their name is an abbreviation of Ouvroir de litt\u00e9rature potentielle (Workshop of Potential Literature), and their work involved the creation of highly constraining rules for the writing of new work. Founded by writer Raymond Queneau, artist Marcel Duchamp, mathematician Fran\u00e7ois Le Lionnais and the self-styled \u2018pataphysicist\u2019<sup>149</sup> Jacques Bens in Paris in November 1960,<sup>150</sup> the group aimed to \u2018apply mathematical structures to writing\u2019,<sup>151</sup> using mathematical constraints to \u2018determine how arbitrary limitations work as aesthetic principles, how, for example, constraints generate innovations\u2019,<sup>152</sup> and thus create \u2018new forms and structures that may be used by writers in any way they see fit.\u2019<sup>153</sup></p> <p>An early example of Oulipian writing is Raymond Queneau\u2019s poem Cent mille milliards de po\u00e8mes (\u2018A Hundred Thousand Billion Poems\u2019).<sup>154</sup> The poem consists of ten pages, each cut into ten strips. Each strip has a line of a sonnet printed onto it, with the same rhyming structure throughout the ten pages. The strips can be combined, from the top of the page to the bottom, in any order, and still create a poem that formally makes sense. Thus, there are 10<sup>10</sup>, or 10,000,000,000 potential poems that can be made; the reading of all combinations is clearly more than several lifetimes\u2019 work. Therefore, Elkin and Esposito argue, \u2018Oulipian literature performs a balancing act between produced and potential work, between what appears on the page and what is suggested beyond it.\u2019<sup>155</sup></p> <p>Implicit within each Oulipean work then, are the writing itself, and all other possible permutations of the same piece that could be created using the same ruleset. The form of the work is as important, if not more so, than the writing it contains. The Oulipo\u2019s layering of mathematical rules was of great appeal to Italian writer Italo Calvino,<sup>156</sup> who encountered the group upon moving to Paris in the early 1960s.<sup>157</sup> The influence on Calvino was profound.<sup>158</sup> In 1967, Calvino authored an essay called Cybernetics and Ghosts, in which he extolled the virtues of the Oulipo in relation to numerous other literary movements, and also explored the potential for computer-driven literature.<sup>159</sup> This essay reveals not only revealed Calvino\u2019s admiration for the Oulipo, but also his sympathy for the modes of enquiry favoured by both of the forms of script theory we have already examined. Like Tomkins, Calvino was inspired by early cyberneticians such as Norbert Weiner, and the excitement of new opportunities offered by \u2018electronic brains\u2019.<sup>160</sup> He declared: \u2018the world in its various aspects is increasingly looked upon as discrete rather than continuous\u2019, and that \u2018faced with the vertigo of what is countless, unclassifiable, in a state of flux, I feel reassured by what is finite, \u201cdiscrete,\u201d and reduced to a system.\u2019<sup>161</sup> This attitude is reflected in the collections of short stories he wrote in the years preceding Cybernetics and Ghosts; each of the Cosmicomics stories applies ideas and rules from a specific scientific \u2018fact\u2019 to create a short work of fiction.<sup>162</sup> It appears to the reader that Calvino was creating discrete rulesets for each story: a principle to work through, explore, and humanise, often in an absurd<sub>a</sub> manner.<sup>163</sup> Many of the Cosmicomics begin with a short statement taken from a scientific article, which acts as context for the story. The Light-Years, for example, start with the premise that the universe is continually expanding, and that at some point in time, two galaxies will never be visible to one another again.<sup>164</sup> The story that follows is absurd<sub>a</sub>, recounting the experiences of a being who sees a handwritten sign on a distant planet and decides to engage in a conversation across the galaxy (with each message taking over 400 million years to send and receive). Simultaneously, it is a story about the physics of such a conversation, the expansion of the universe, human insecurity, and the impossibility of communication (a theme popular with absurdists). Cosmicomics show that Calvino had a long-standing love of rule-based writing; by the time he wrote Cybernetics and Ghosts, he had already translated Queneau\u2019s work into Italian.<sup>165</sup> He was formally invited into the group in 1973 \u2013 the same year he published The Burning of the Abominable House \u2013\u00a0having already written several more stories that seemed to have an Oulipian influence.<sup>166</sup></p> <p>The Burning of the Abominable House is remarkable due to its use of a computer programme to create the story; Calvino worked with programmer Paul Braffort to achieve this computer-scripted workflow.<sup>167</sup> The premise is relatively simple: an insurance investigator is looking into a house-fire, in which four bodies were found. Alongside the inhabitants (all of whom had insurance policies with the same company), the charred remains of a notebook\u2019s front cover survived, with Accounts of horrible acts perpetrated in this house written on its front. On its back is a list of 12 headings (such as to bind and gag, to blackmail, to seduce). The order in which the crimes were committed is not known, and the combinations of possible events make traditional linear combinatorics (such as seen in Queneau\u2019s One Hundred Thousand Billion Poems) impossible, since several of the characters\u2019 actions infer the death of their intended victim \u2013\u00a0after which, the victim cannot do anything.<sup>168</sup> Thus, in the story, the insurance agent has written a computer programme that will help them find the only logical sequences of events, given a primitive set of information about the characters\u2019 relationships before the fire took place. In reality, Calvino worked with the computer programmer Paul Braffort (a fellow Oulipian) to create a series of programmes to solve the mystery, creating a narrative that \u2018remain[^s] \u201clogically\u201d and \u201cpsychologically\u201d acceptable\u2019. Calvino argues that:</p> <p>[...] the aid of a computer, far from replacing the creative act of the artist, permits the latter rather to liberate himself from the slavery of a combinatory search, allowing him also the best chance of concentrating on this \u201cclinamen\u201d which, alone, can make of text a true work of art.<sup>169</sup></p> <p>In the tradition of the Oulipo, this work\u2019s translation is presented in The New Media Reader<sup>170</sup> (and in its original form, in the Oulipo\u2019s Atlas de litt\u00e9rature potentielle compendium)<sup>171</sup> without the final solution \u2013 in other words, the potential forms the story may take are more important than the final outcome of the work.<sup>172</sup></p> <p>Paul Fournel provides a taxonomy of the roles played by computers in the Oulipian work carried out at the Centre Pompidou, including by Calvino and Queneau.<sup>173</sup> He distinguishes between the role of \u2018aided reading\u2019 and \u2018aided creation\u2019. Aided reading brings a computer into the interpretation of existing literary material, such as in enabling an audience to generate one of the many available sonnets from One Hundred Thousand Billion Poems on cue, whereas aided creation invites a computational element into the creation of work (as with Calvino\u2019s Burning of the Abominable House).

This method is used in most design projects this thesis will examine; computer scripting of this sort is a methodological practicality to almost anyone working with computer-aided design today. This does not mean that the use of computer script is a purely functional tool; the shape of a project is often determined in part by the language, libraries and dependencies used within it. The scripts can include references to external and internal libraries, languages, logic operators, parameters, and variables. They can process many formats of information.<sup>177</sup> Scripts can be written and executed asynchronously, and multiple scripts can operate on the same computer at once.</p> <p>In code form, the computer script acts as a mode of diagram; a procedural set of instructions that manipulate the symbols the programme works with. For the most part, parameters are defined in advance, and the programme will only make changes to and within these pre-defined variables. The computer script is then a one-dimensional plan.</p> <p>The development of computer scripts in this thesis follows a largely code-based approach (see chapters 1, 2 and 3), although projects in chapters 2 and 3 (Scriptych and 24fps Psycho) also employ Max, a visual programming language that operates in a \u2018diagrammatic\u2019 manner. Where possible, source code, screenshots and schematics are included in the appendix of this thesis. The person writing the code is its author. The computer, whilst executing the code, is in a sense \u2018performing\u2019 the script; the output will be examined and scrutinised, live, or later. The author thus becomes audience, and, like a theatrical audience, becomes a part of the performance.<sup>178</sup> In the instance of live computer scripting, a secondary audience are also watching the performance.

The initial basis for my research was within Deleuze\u2019s Postscript on the Control Society.<sup>180</sup> Written in 1990, and building on the work of Foucault (in particular his notion of biopolitics), as well as Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s extensive body of work, this short essay poses the hypothesis that power within society is undergoing a transformation away from discipline societies \u2013 highly regimented, formal expressions of dominance (of the kind found in institutions such as schools, the military and factories) \u2013\u00a0and towards control societies, which remove the former formal delineations, to the extent that: <sup>181</sup></p> <p>one is never finished with anything \u2013 the corporation, the educational system, the armed services being metastable states coexisting in one and the same modulation, like a universal system of deformation.<sup>182</sup></p> <p>Deleuze argues that the machines a society use are in fact a reflection of the society itself, \u2018because they express those social forms capable of generating them and using them.\u2019<sup>183</sup> Whilst discipline societies constructed clockwork mechanisms, levers, and pulleys, control societies make use of a new type of machine: computers.<sup>184</sup> He goes on to describe a city imagined by F\u00e9lix Guattari, in which inhabitants each carry electronic access cards. The cards allow access to different parts of the city, so that, to leave an apartment, or exit a street or neighbourhood, the card must be presented. Such a system would necessarily allow for the rejection of access at certain times. \u2018what counts is not the barrier but the computer that tracks each person\u2019s position \u2013\u00a0licit or illicit \u2013 and effects a universal modulation.\u2019<sup>185</sup></p> <p>Tung-Hui Hu, in the book A Prehistory of the Cloud, states that this specific prediction now seems mundane;<sup>186</sup> e-card access now a standard feature of university, hospital, and corporate campuses, not to mention metropolitan transport systems. However, the core concepts of the control society today persist in far more pervasive modes; often these contain their own internal logics and contradictions, and subtly change individuals\u2019 potential range of behaviours, to the extent that we might identify a certain type of script, as in ruleset, emerge. Hu argues that this regulation of behaviour can often occur from within the individual as a mode of self-regulation. He uses the example of credit cards to explain this principle. Credit allowances are dependent on past behaviour; in order to make a $100,000 purchase, a user would benefit from buying a \u2018series of $1000 meals over a period of time\u2019<sup>187</sup> in order to fit the profile of a high spender. Fraud detection works in the same manner; purchases outside of a user\u2019s \u2018normal\u2019 behaviour patterns trigger a rejection of a transaction.<sup>188</sup> Hu continues:</p> <p>Somewhere, a computer is calculating the impact of each spending decision and adjusting to it in real time, and, in turn, the cardholders adjust, too. \u2018You\u2019 are a set of spending patterns, and that projected profile both enables the bank to extend credit to you as well as puts the onus on you to take responsibility for those spending patterns. [...] The core idea behind a control society, then, is thus a continuous set of cybernetic systems, financial incentives, and monitoring technologies moulded to each individual subject, that follow him or her even when \u2018outside\u2019 an institution as such; and, precisely because there are fewer explicit institutions, spaces, or rules to restrict the subject\u2019s behaviours, these systems are often experienced as freeing.<sup>189</sup></p> <p>This assertion is particularly true of so-called \u2018big data\u2019<sup>190</sup> that is generated around individuals as a result of modern interactions with (or use of) technology.<sup>191</sup> Companies such as Google and Facebook, credit agencies such as Experian, and multiple other data analysis companies now collect and analyse vast troves of data through myriad means;<sup>192</sup> use of apps and services on a smartphone, a credit card, a transport system, or a website, each person creates data trails which can be analysed to make inferences and predictions about them. As the University of Cambridge\u2019s Human-Data Interaction working group note, the processes and decisions behind these inferences are often hidden from the public, as the aggregation and use of such data is \u2018at the heart of most Internet business models, particularly those based on advertising and market intelligence.\u2019<sup>193</sup> This problem plays out in two ways: users are often unaware both of the data being collected about them, and the inferences drawn from those data.<sup>194</sup> As Aradau points out: \u2018The reader never knows the mechanisms through which the results are produced \u2013 but needs to rely and trust those who know \u2013 while not being able to participate in the production of knowledge.\u2019<sup>195</sup></p> <p>One example of an absurd<sub>b</sub> limitation on individuals\u2019 ability to participate in the production of this knowledge can be found in standard End User License Agreements (EULAs) or Terms of Service (ToS). An EULA/ToS in a technological context is an agreement by an end-user to abide by rules set by the service provider. In order to use iTunes, the software that allows an iPhone to synchronise with an Apple Computer, for example, a user must agree, among other things, that the software will not be used for \u2018the development, design, manufacture, or production of nuclear missile, or chemical or biological weapons.\u2019<sup>196</sup> A 2012 article on consumer website Which? noted that the iTunes EULA at the time was longer than Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth.<sup>197</sup> It is clearly the case that most users of these services do not read the myriad agreements they sign up to; reading and assessing terms of service for every app, service, or product that they use would yield little benefit. Rather, the \u2018freeing\u2019 experience described by Hu draws users to services without analysing the potential cost. One of the reasons that this analysis doesn\u2019t generally take place is that often using a service offers a binary \u2018Agree/Disagree\u2019 option (the consequence of disagreeing generally being that you cannot use the service). This is exemplified by the controversial \u2018taxi\u2019<sup>198</sup> service Uber: to use the Uber app on an iPhone \u2013 the central premise of which is that a taxi can be ordered from your precise location \u2013 the user can choose to share their location \u2018never\u2019 or \u2018always\u2019. The former would render much of Uber\u2019s functionality useless; the latter would grant Uber the knowledge of the users\u2019 phone location, and by inference the location of the user, at all times that it is on.<sup>199</sup></p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch0/#absurd-control","title":"Absurd control","text":"<p>There are two ways in which this relationship could be described as absurd. The first is in the lack of agency that individuals have in their relationship to technology. Technological products and services are often presented with a fait accompli, something inevitable and unchangeable. The carrot is just too juicy. Deleuze uses the following metaphor: \u2018Man is no longer man enclosed, but man in debt.\u2019<sup>200</sup> In this case, the unending debt owed by is paid off through the sharing of personal information, for unseen use. The inherent lack of agency \u2013\u00a0over both desire and the terms of use \u2013 is reminiscent of the characters in Ionesco\u2019s play Rhinoceros, where one by one inhabitants of a village inexplicably turn into rhinoceroses; control over one\u2019s individual actions are ceded to a mysterious \u2018other\u2019 power, subject to irrational desires. In this case, technology comes from \u2018elsewhere\u2019: conceived of in California, manufactured in South Asia, delivered to your door.<sup>201</sup></p> <p>The second mode of absurdity is in the behaviours that networked computational technology creates within the individuals who use it. Foucault described governmentality as the \u2018conduct of conduct\u2019.<sup>202</sup> In an edited volume on Foucault\u2019s concept of governmentality, Colin Gordon explains:</p> <p>Government as an activity could concern the relation between self and self, private interpersonal relations within social institutions and communities and, finally, relations concerned with the exercise of political sovereignty.<sup>203</sup></p> <p>Within networked computation, Hu argues that users are often the subject to self-policing, although the intentions behind these actions are often for rational reasons. Users of the \u2018cloud\u2019, he argues, are invested with myths \u2018about security and participation\u2019.<sup>204</sup> Behaviours tend towards normalising behaviour, often through the perceived positive or negative impact something may have on the security of the system itself; marking messages as spam, or tagging photos on Facebook, \u2018construct a set of cultural norms that we internalise as \u201cresponsible\u201d online behaviour\u2019.<sup>205</sup> Use of networked technology affects its users behaviour in the present through the creation of internalised rules akin to scripted behaviour (itself an absurd<sub>a</sub> behaviour). But this behavioural change is a reflection of the \u2018invisible rules and systems of regulation\u2019 observed in Postscript on the Societies of Control.<sup>206</sup></p> <p>Networked technologies simultaneously lead to the modification of its users\u2019 behaviour in the present, and the future. In the present, users often project the impact of their actions as previously discussed. In the future, the range of possibilities available to an individual is largely determined by inferences made through data. In some cases this appears trivial; Facebook, being an advertising-based platform dependent on keeping its users happy, will serve adverts and stories that its algorithms determine the user is likely to \u2018like\u2019. Haddidi et al note, with a slight absurd<sub>a</sub> comicality, that:</p> <p>the inferences drawn from our personal data are also sometimes wrong \u2013\u00a0certainly if the adverts shown in the authors' Facebook news feeds are anything to go by, mostly wrong. This can be due to poor quality input data, sometimes itself the output of an inference process, or simply the statistical nature of the inference process analysing the data. However the algorithms cannot know this, and we, the users, frequently do not know when invalid inferences have been drawn.<sup>207</sup></p> <p>However, Facebook\u2019s shift from mere social media platform, connecting people, to being a primary source of news and opinion for many people, has led to a phenomenon known as the \u2018filter bubble\u2019. Users, by \u2018liking\u2019, \u2018sharing\u2019, and \u2018commenting\u2019 on news that reinforces their world-view, are more likely to consequently be fed stories that are harmonious with this view. Consequently, people are seen to be more likely to polarise their political opinions. However, there is great potential for absurd<sub>a</sub> algorithmic mis-inference, with absurd<sub>b</sub> results. Where these comical mis-inferences have impact on peoples\u2019 lives \u2013\u00a0a mortgage application being tied to one\u2019s travel records, thus inferring if they have a regular job (or even show a tendency to be late for work) could have more concrete, but untraceable, absurd<sub>b</sub> impacts.<sup>208</sup></p> <p>Finally, there is an absurd element to the use of big data for what may be its most famous usage: prediction of terror incidents. In the wake of the Snowden leaks, which revealed the existence of huge \u2018drag-net\u2019 data collection programmes in the USA, the UK, and others, largely under the premise of improving state security through the prevention of terrorism, Aradau probes the metaphors which are used to describe the security services\u2019 activities:<sup>209</sup> searching for \u2018the needle in a haystack\u2019 and gazing into a \u2018crystal ball\u2019.<sup>210</sup> Both methods are flawed, for different reasons, she concludes. The \u2018logic of resemblance\u2019 in searching for \u2018clues\u2019 (such as the \u2018needle in the haystack\u2019) relies on \u2018four methods of knowledge production: convenience (convenientia), emulation (aemulatio), analogy and sympathy.\u2019<sup>211</sup> However:</p> <p>In a world where the \u2018next terrorist attack\u2019 is unexpected and unpredictable, where the future event is always already different from past events, there are no predictable expectations in reality against which the anomaly can stand out. Rather, the intelligence agencies argue that the hay field \u2013 all the data \u2013 is needed first in order to derive both expectations about normality and the anomalous elements. Big data is the new whole. The normal and the anomalous, the haystack and the clue, are supposed to emerge from big data. The epistemic logic is not that of locating and assembling insignificant details that stand out against the background of social order, but reading the data in order to produce the normal and the anomalous. For security professionals, the hunt for terrorists cannot be based on past knowledge as terrorists change their methods all the time.<sup>212</sup></p> <p>Using the technique of analogy, for example, leads to the absurd situation where \u2018[^a]ny action, any characteristic, can become the sign of terrorist activity \u2013 from buying a one-way plane ticket to reading online material.\u2019<sup>213</sup> The scale of inferences is potentially absurd:</p> <p>Big data reasoning combines a veneer of rationality \u2013 algorithmic logic and probabilistic calculations \u2013 with the irrationality of telling the future from data \u2018signatures\u2019. Everything has a \u2018data signature\u2019 and everything can be derived from data in a never-ending loop of adding variables and correspondences. Big data is rendered as an inescapable system not only from which there is no place to hide, but where it is impossible to think the error of knowledge.<sup>214</sup></p> <p>Aradau concludes that both analogies for this use of data do not work; the needle in the haystack relies on past events matching future ones, whilst the crystal ball displays an irrational faith in the needle in the haystack approach that is akin to divination. She concludes by comparing contemporary big data approaches to preventing terrorism to astrology, via a quote by Theodor Adorno, extolling the absurdity<sub>a</sub> of this mode of big data prediction:</p> <p>\u2018There is nothing irrational about astrology\u2019, concluded Adorno, \u2018except its decisive contention that these two spheres of rational knowledge are interconnected, whereas not the slightest evidence of such an interconnection can be offered.\u2019<sup>215</sup></p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch0/#absurd-machines-and-diagrams","title":"Absurd machines and diagrams","text":"<p>The relationship between technology and the absurd informs the methodological framework for the works discussed in this thesis, via mechanism I refer to as the \u2018absurd machine\u2019: an assemblage of components which hint at the absurd<sub>b</sub> nature of a larger technological system that increasingly compromises human agency and determines the mode of existence.</p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch0/#absurd-machines","title":"Absurd machines","text":"<p>The term \u2018machine\u2019 is used intentionally for its ambiguity; a device that could be interpreted as a physical mechanical object, or a bigger generative system. The definition of the term has acquired ambiguities of meaning over time concerning its scale and objecthood. Examination of the etymology reveals that the eleven senses of the word deriving from its original Middle French root were each implemented at roughly the time of the technological or scientific discovery or development, which lead to the word\u2019s broadened definition.<sup>216</sup> The oldest quoted example of the word in the OED is from 1545, and refers to a machine as \u2018a material or immaterial structure, esp. the fabric of the world or universe.\u2019<sup>217</sup> Over time, the word has come to refer to smaller entities seen to have this same essential quality of unity, through a material or immaterial structure: from the Descartean notion of body as machine (first quoted by Shakespeare in 1604); to the idea of an apparatus which completes a specific task; to the straightforward mechanism (such as a car); to the male penis.<sup>218</sup></p> <p>The scalar variability of the term \u2018machine\u2019 has been explored by philosopher Manuel de Landa within the framework of what Deleuze and Guattari have called the \u2018machinic phylum\u2019, in both his essay of the same name, and the 1991 book War in the Age of Intelligent Machines.<sup>219</sup> In his discussion of Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s notion, De Landa describes \u2018phylum\u2019 \u2013 a term taken from zoology \u2013 as a taxonomy above 'class', but below 'kingdom', implying that the conception of a machine is closer to that of a system, or operational group, than a fixed object; it refers to the consolidation of what would otherwise be \u2018merely coexisting, heterogeneous elements\u2019<sup>220</sup> into \u2018a novel entity.\u2019<sup>221</sup> As De Landa points out, this can operate across scales:</p> <p>In one sense, the term [^machinic phylum] refers to any population (of atoms, molecules, cells, insects) whose global dynamics are governed by singularities (bifurcations and attractors); in another sense, it refers to the integration of a collection of elements into an assemblage that is more than the sum of its parts, that is, one that displays global properties not possessed by its individual components.<sup>222</sup></p> <p>Thus, De Landa claims, the same methodology could be applied to \u2018all the different structures that inhabit our universe\u2019:<sup>223</sup> military institutions and war machines,<sup>224</sup> books (\u2018A book itself is a little machine\u2019),<sup>225</sup> rivers (which act as a pebble \u2018sorting machine\u2019),<sup>226</sup> geological stratification,<sup>227</sup> bureaucracies,<sup>228</sup> faciality,<sup>229</sup> wolves,<sup>230</sup> and anuses<sup>231</sup> all are machines as they are systems that amount to more than the aggregate of their components.</p> <p>In this sense, the Theatre of the Absurd could be described as an absurd<sub>b</sub> machine comprising an assemblage of plays, which are in turn absurd<sub>b</sub> machines. One of the intended effects of absurdist theatre is to trigger the realisation of the absurd<sub>b</sub> in the mind of the observer. As Camus describes it, this realisation is machinic in its manifestation, the emergent product of a catalyst, such as seeing a man in a telephone booth. The purpose of the projects presented in this thesis is similar; each project is an assemblage of components which hint at the absurd<sub>b</sub> nature of a larger, usually external, machine such as the technology industry or a Russian propaganda agency. Like the above definitions of machines, there are no fixed formal parameters that define the projects I describe here; they all deal with related subject areas, and work through a series of similar processes to achieve their goals, although the output of each project varies tremendously.</p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch0/#diagrams","title":"Diagrams","text":"<p>Within this methodology, I use the concept of the \u2018diagram\u2019 to articulate the relationships and mechanisms that constitute each absurd machine.

However, as Mark Garcia has noted, while the term is \u2018as old as architecture itself\u2019,<sup>233</sup> the study of architectural diagrams within the practice of architecture is relatively new;<sup>234</sup> his book The Diagrams of Architecture claims to be the first anthology to present the histories, texts and theories of the architectural diagram in its current guise.<sup>235</sup> His work builds on, and is supplemented by, that of Peter Eisenman, who has carried out extensive work in this field.</p> <p>This thesis aims to bridge between this more traditional conception of the diagram, and Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s articulation of the diagram as an \u2018abstract machine \u2026 a map of relations between forces\u2019.<sup>236</sup> Here the distinction is perhaps between the notion of the diagram as a noun, and a verb; an outcome and a process.<sup>237</sup> For Deleuze \u2013 who has written extensively on the subject \u2013 a diagram, at its most fundamental, is a mode of \u2018conveying information about something incorporeal.\u2019<sup>238</sup> This can be broken down into three essential typologies: the plan (e.g. the \u2018building that is not yet built\u2019), the map (e.g. \u2018terrains not yet travelled\u2019), and the graph (i.e. \u2018relations between variable qualities\u2019).<sup>239</sup> Within this thesis, each of these typologies is used within different contexts to illustrate different concerns: where plans are employed, for example, they are generally diagrams of something that will exist in the future, such as, in chapter 4, in which shooting diagrams are prepared for a film, or in the conclusion to chapter 3, where a description of an incomplete project plan is described. They are created with the full knowledge that they are subject to change. This is true of any form of premeditated script (e.g. film or theatrical script); they are subject to interpretation when actually implemented.

This means that there must be a breadth and depth of research into the subject area. This research should encompass both paper-based forms, and immersive techniques; for example, if working on a project relating to machine learning, one must learn the fundamental principles and mechanics of the field (i.e. conduct a formal or informal literature review of key principles and practitioners), as well as gain experience putting these principles to use (through, say, learning how to train a machine to recognise handwriting samples using the MNIST dataset via online tutorials).<sup>240</sup> The combination of these practices enables the project to communicate a theoretically grounded, yet subjective viewpoint on a subject.</p> <p>The subjectivity of the knowledge contained within my projects is fundamental to their execution; as an independent practitioner, my role is to communicate what I know through the projects themselves.

From irational.org <p>Heath Bunting is a British artist who works on the subject of identity and sovereignty, and his research is both theoretically based and immersive. His Status Project<sup>246</sup> traces the legal signifiers that surround the construction of a legal person according to UK law. Distinguishing between human beings, natural persons (\u2018an objectified human being\u2019;<sup>247</sup> the set of legal constructs which make a human a person), and artificial persons (\u2018generally objectified collectives of natural person(s)\u2019, i.e. corporations), Bunting examines the elements of law that have enabled corporations to gain legal personhood.<sup>248</sup> The work takes the form of large maps formed from relational databases of possessions and statuses. A1034: A Human Being Normal is a portrait of Bunting, revealing how his status at the time of execution is formed.<sup>249</sup> The map is a flow-chart: flowing to the right, with constituent elements being introduced on the left, nodal point \u201809438: a human being normal\u2019 is a status that is achieved by combination of \u201803208: a human being able to provide age\u2019, \u201803410: a human being able to provide name (forename / nickname)\u2019, \u201809435: a human being able to provide nationality\u2019, and crucially \u201801187: a human being alive\u2019. \u201801187: a human being alive\u2019 is itself a product of \u201805021: a human being in possession of basic needs\u2019 and not \u201807521: a human being dead\u2019.</p> <p>The object rationality that is displayed in the categorisation is inherently humorous, and draws upon the vocabulary of British legal processes; Bunting explained at a conference in Nottingham<sup>250</sup> that the reason he began making such maps was due to an incident in which he fell onto a terrorist watch-list, and was detained by intelligence services. He used his recent artistic commission from the Tate to create a map of his status at the time, in an attempt to diagram the absurdity of a system whereby every action he could take would only put him under more suspicion. As Sadie Plant wrote of the piece:</p> <p>The terrorist is one of several identities explored by Bunting in\u00a0The Status Project, a body of work which draws our attention to the astounding degree to which the citizens of the UK have their lives overseen and their identities constructed by the state bodies and corporations with which they interact. No opportunity is missed for movements to be tracked: purchases are recorded, information is gathered, footage is shot, images are stored.<sup>251</sup></p> <p>The Status Project follows on from Bunting\u2019s Border Xing project, which sought to examine the practicalities of crossing borders within the EU, supposedly a zone with free movement of people.<sup>252</sup> The artist travelled around Europe for a year, documenting the ability to pass from one country to another without detection. The work was presented as a guidebook, as well as a website (which was, for the projects\u2019 launch, password-protected; the protection has since been removed).</p> <p>Bunting\u2019s work has relevance for my practice for several reasons. He is an artist who works in a similar subject matter and medium, using databases to highlight the absurd<sub>a+b</sub> construction of identity and status in modern states. His work relies on a high level of immersion in his subject, physically crossing borders and testing the legal limits of his identity practice. His presentation of work is both comical and detailed (in A Terrorist, for example, the A-Z map logo and indexing system is employed, giving the impression that navigating one\u2019s identity as a suspected terrorist is whimsically easy).<sup>253</sup></p> Figure 0-2: Detail of Bunting\u2019s map of a terrorist.

New York, 2012.   Note, in the PDF version of the thesis, this figure is a series of stills from the film. <p>New York-based artist Tom Sachs is a sculptor who creates artworks via a process he describes as \u2018bricolage\u2019. His sculptures and films are embedded in the grammar of American pop culture, graphic and industrial design, and film. The 2016 film A Space Program<sup>254</sup> documents Studio Sachs\u2019 2012 imagining and enacting of a NASA Apollo space programme journey to Mars.<sup>255</sup> The project followed an extensive period of research into technologies and techniques used by NASA for the training of astronauts in the 1960s. The studio then painstakingly recreated, from a limited palette of materials and processes, a range of vehicles, costumes, sets, and live special effects that would enable members of the studio to perform a hypothetical mission, travelling to Mars and collecting a \u2018soil sample\u2019. The entire re-enactment would take place, however, in the Park Avenue Armory \u2013\u00a0a large warehouse-performance space two blocks from Central Park in Manhattan. The accompanying film (directed by long-time collaborator Van Neistat) shows both the mission as a large-scale performative spectacle, whereby an audience in the same building watch from stadium seating as the \u2018mission\u2019 takes place, willing it on, and the preparations and studio ethos which led to the mission\u2019s conception and execution in the first place.</p> <p>Sachs\u2019 studio is well-established in New York; he has rented the same space since 1989.<sup>256</sup> The studio enforces a strict code upon its workers and visitors, which have been formalised and codified in the film \u2018Ten Bullets\u2019.<sup>257</sup> Each of the \u2018bullets\u2019 is a short, succinct and humorous guide to the specific use of materials, colours, measurements, storage of tools and behaviours permitted for use inside the studio. Another video, \u2018COLOR\u2019,<sup>258</sup> acts as a 26-minute treatise on the limited colour palette the studio permits: Rich in pop culture references, the film opens to the regal, sinister Wendy Carlos-composed theme music from Stanley Kubrick\u2019s A Clockwork Orange.<sup>259</sup> Soon, a firm, precise British voice announces: \u2018Developed over decades, our colour code consists of a finite and precise palette. [...] The colour code is non-negotiable; we do not stray from the colour code.\u2019<sup>260</sup> The video, both comical and informative, consists almost entirely of special effects made in-studio (and in-camera); it tells the audience exactly which colours they can use, down to the suppliers that make them. We learn, for example, that: The five chosen colours are not only named, they are given characters, a wealth of pop-culture references<sup>261</sup> that root them in time, justifying their presence in the limited palette. Yellow is \u2018either McDonalds yellow or Kodak yellow\u2019,<sup>262</sup> whilst for red: \u2018we paint with McDonalds Red. McDonalds Red is Benjamin Moore Impervex Latex High Gloss Metal and Wood Enamel, Brilliant Red 309 20, or Krylon Industrial 2108 Banner Safety Red.\u2019<sup>263</sup> Unsurprisingly, Sachs studio rule also insists that construction of projects takes place in a specific order: wood, for example, must be painted before it is cut or sanded, rather than after. This means that the wood takes on a particular appearance which is in line with Sachs\u2019 practice of bricolage; the surface becomes scratched and shipped, and the appearance of objects gains a certain naivety. Bricolage, explained Sachs in a discussion in Chicago, <sup>264</sup> is the means by which the studio produces its work; having initially trained as a sculptor, and thinking that craftsmanship implied the removal of signifiers of the handmade, Sachs later realised that the process of production should in fact be a more prominent part of the work itself. In order to leave a human impression on objects, plywood is always to be painted before it is cut. This means that the imperfections, a quality of human craftsmanship, are left on the objects; chips and scrapes, the trace of their construction.<sup>265</sup> The models and artefacts created by the studio all show these qualities, a deliberate naivety, use of form, material, colour and sign of process that unites the objects into a distinct family. It is precisely these imperfections which lend such charm to the audacious space programme artworks; there is a clear level of humour in the use of an umbrella as a satellite dish.</p> <p>Sachs\u2019 studio ethos offers two principles that are of use to this thesis: the honesty of forms that reveal the processes that created them, and the humour inherent within the undertaking of an absurd task. The work shows that, in taking on a patently ridiculous activity, but approaching it with utmost sincerity and a depth of both theoretical and technical immersion, an artwork that is genuinely moving can be created.</p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch0/#the-absurd","title":"The absurd","text":"<p>Does the project make use of humour (is it absurd<sub>a</sub>)?Does the project hint at the absurd<sub>b</sub>?</p> <p>Much of the content of this thesis deals with absurd<sub>b</sub> topics and themes.

Note: In the PDF version of this thesis, this figure is comprised of stills from this film.    <p>Francis Al\u00ffs is a Belgian-born, Mexico-based artist who initially trained (and practiced) in architecture. His work frequently makes use of the absurd; When Faith Moves Mountains<sup>266</sup> and El Ensayo<sup>267</sup> are both examples of this. When Faith Moves Mountains is an absurd<sub>a+b</sub> work: a team of 500 volunteers gather together with shovels, and spend hours working together to collectively displace a Peruvian sand dune, 500 metres in length, by just 10cm.<sup>268</sup> The work is absurd<sub>a</sub> in its sheer comical nature; the act itself has no functional purpose but to make a metaphorical statement (as one volunteer states \u2018it\u2019s the mirror of a society, the mirror of a moment in society\u2019).<sup>269</sup> Yet in utilizing labour as a mediator, Al\u00ffs creates an incongruous situation, in which the tension between art and socio-political reality is maintained: a huge workforce is mobilized to literally sculpt the landscape, the effect of which is barely noticeable; the useless, ephemeral act of art-making simultaneously shapes a momentary communal subjectivity, effectively \u2018de-romanticiz[^ing]\u2019 and politicising Land Art.<sup>270</sup> Fluctuating between emancipation and restraint, individual and collective identity, grand gesture and menial task, art and life, the piece operates within a series of dialogues. Furthermore, the crucial presence of physical labour as the arbitrator illustrates the extent to which the global economy creates a demand for meaningless objects and tedious manual-labour, subverting as if to parody the capitalist mantra in a single statement: \u2018maximum input, minimum output\u2019.<sup>271</sup></p> <p>This event was the result of intensive research into the historical context of Peru, the significance of the site, and the consultation and collaboration with curator Cuauht\u00e9moc Medina and film maker Raphael Ortega. Created for the Lima Biennale, itself a form of solidarity against the regime, Al\u00ffs\u2019s work emphasizes the state of Peruvian inhabitants as a forced community, shunted from centre to periphery via economic necessity, to form temporary shanty-towns that have become permanent dwellings.<sup>272</sup> The repetitive and inconclusive nature of the action highlights the continual failed attempts at constructing a national identity throughout a history divided by civil war and plagued by the horrors of Fujimori\u2019s regime.<sup>273</sup> Thus the work is critical and poignant through the use of an absurd mechanism.</p> <p>In the work El Ensayo, a red Volkswagen Beetle \u2013 a common car in Mexico \u2013 repeatedly attempts to drive up a hillside in Tijuana, Mexico.<sup>274</sup> Accompanying the video is a cacophonic big band momentarily playing jazz. Every time the car nears the top of the hill, the music stops, and the car rolls backwards to the bottom of the hill again. It is unclear whether the music is driving the car, or the car driving the music, but each time the car gets tantalisingly close to the top of the hill, it just cannot make it all the way up. The video is nearly half an hour in length. As the scene continues, it becomes funnier and funnier. Eventually, the car reverses to where it began, out of the frame to the left of the camera. This work plays with the classical absurdist notion of the Myth of Sisyphus, discussed by Camus in the book that introduced the philosophical absurd in 1942.<sup>275</sup></p> <p>Both works use metaphor and performance to express a sense of absurd<sub>b</sub> futility. As curator Russell Ferguson notes in an essay on Al\u00ffs, the artist takes a joy in the incompleteness of his own work; he has \u2018adopted a way of working that tends to reject conclusions in favour of repetition and recalibration. He has, that is, put the idea of rehearsal at the heart of his practice.\u2019<sup>276</sup> Ferguson (who has previously curated Al\u00ffs\u2019 work) notes, almost with frustration, that there is a lack of closure to the artists\u2019 works; they are in a continuous state of rehearsal and potential alteration:</p> <p>For Al\u00ffs, then, the final work is always in some sense projected into the future, a future that is always advancing just ahead of the work. In the interim it can constantly be revisited, and its presence can be constantly shape-shifting, not just in the form of documentation through photographs or video, but also through written descriptions or oral accounts passed from person to person.<sup>277</sup></p> <p>Al\u00ffs\u2019 presentation of work is, like Sachs, highly accessible, despite the potentially morbid subject of existential angst it is dealing with. The documentary video about When Faith Moves Mountains shows Al\u00ffs; engagement with a local college to recruit volunteers to the project.<sup>278</sup> Samuel Beckett famously rarely discussed the meaning of his work in public; in the documentary, it is only the voices of the volunteering participants who express any potential symbolic meaning the piece has. The humour and warmth of Al\u00ffs\u2019 work is a big influence on my own.</p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch0/#charlie-kaufman","title":"Charlie Kaufman","text":"Figure 0-5: Stills from Kaufman\u2019s Synecdoche, New York show the construction of successive replica warehouses inside each other; the film\u2019s protagonist writes instructions to the thousands of actors in his play. Kaufman, Charlie. Synecdoche, New York. \u00a9 Sony Pictures Classics, 2008.    <p>On a similar theme of unfinished work, Charlie Kaufman\u2019s film Synecdoche, New York presents the story of a theatrical director producing an eternally unfinished work that continually grows in scale and ambition.<sup>279</sup> The film is a musing on the nature of creativity, the desire for perfection and the potential of creeping scope for creative work. It combines many elements of the absurd<sub>a+b</sub>. In the film, director Caden Cotard wins a Macarthur Genius Grant for his theatrical production of Death of a Salesman. This enables him to begin production of a large-scale, ambitious play within a large warehouse in Schenectady, New York. At the same time, his marriage to a portrait painter falls apart, and his wife moves to Berlin with their young daughter. However, Cotard focuses on his work; within the warehouse, he builds a scale model of the city outside, and hires a large team of actors to populate it and perform as normal people, each with their own lives, relationships, and daily tragic instructions to react to. Within the city-set, there is a scale model of the warehouse itself, and soon this becomes populated with a smaller model of the original set. A whole team of actors who resemble the originals is hired to work inside the second warehouse. Cotard\u2019s life becomes entangled with the actors, and more replica sets and actors begin shadowing each other. As his work increases in its physical scale and ambition, his wife\u2019s paintings become smaller and smaller, to the extent that when she has a retrospective in New York, the audience must wear magnifying glasses to see the microscopic works.</p> <p>The film is layered with absurd<sub>a+b</sub> elements: the portrayal of time is skewed, so that what appears to be a few weeks in the film is actually a series of discrete moments months apart; there are repeated moments of mis-hearing, and use of non-sequiturs. The title of the film itself is a play on words: it is set in Schenectady, New York, but called Synecdoche, New York (the figure of speech whereby a small part represents a whole): the film itself becomes a Synecdoche of New York; and the lead character is named after a delusion in which a person believes they are already dead.<sup>280</sup></p> <p>Kaufman has written other films that also deal with absurd<sub>b</sub> themes (Being John Malkovich in particular; also Adaptation and Anomalisa), but Synechdoche, New York is the most explicitly relevant to this thesis.<sup>281</sup> The film\u2019s form is thoroughly reflective of its content: densely layered, a grand statement on the notion of creating, and ultimately with a feeling that it has a lack of resolution (like the play it is about). Kaufman has stated that he is aware of absurdist plays, but his method of creating films that truly hint at absurd<sub>b</sub> themes in a modern context, that are both hilarious and existentially absurd, is a key influence in the creation of my work.<sup>282</sup></p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch0/#practice","title":"Practice","text":"<p>The work presented in the chapters of this PhD was completed between September 2012 and July 2015.

Although not directly employing the term \u2018script\u2019 (yet using multiple other theatrical terms, such as \u2018stage\u2019 and \u2018backstage\u2019), the facility employs many elements that facilitate scripted interactions within its care-giving. Organised as a small, enclosed village in which residents are free to wander around, and fall into scripted behaviour patterns (e.g. buying food in a supermarket, going to the pub or theatre, attending a flower-fair). Staff do not wear care uniforms, but instead play roles that enable them to subtly provide care for residents: some work as waiters in the restaurants, others may appear as a friend who is cooking dinner. This enables the patients to fall into scripted behavioural patterns, social interactions. The particular living arrangements (houses and social interactions) are organised by socioeconomic groups, so that scripts that the patient is accustomed to are those most naturally occurring.

It draws upon Gregory Bateson\u2019s Theory of Play and Fantasy, and Barry and Born\u2019s work in defining sci-art practice, and refers to two projects: Ant Ballet and the Godot Machine. These projects were initiated before the start of my PhD (with iterations of both forming part of my MArch portfolio) but continued into the first year of doctoral research, and were central to the development of later work.<sup>1</sup> In particular, it was in the production of these pieces that diagramming first entered my practice, with both works taking the form of machines that manifested specific diagrammatic systems.</p> <p>It should be noted that the Godot Machine and Ant Ballet are used here purposes of reference only, and not as part of my thesis portfolio (this is clarified by appendicising all technical information for both projects). In addition to the methodological role they play, these works represent and define a major shift in the framing of my work away from the \u2018sci-art\u2019 genre.<sup>2</sup> As such, I use them here as a basis for the critique of that field, and the platform upon which to build a more theoretically robust definition of my practice. This chapter focuses on the re-establishing the intention behind these works, defining the framing and diagramming processes that emerged from them, and assessing their implications for other projects in this thesis. As an Arts and Humanities Research Council-funded PhD has a responsibility to discuss methods and processes involved in the creation of work, I see these works as essential reference points for the thesis, acting as a catalyst for future projects, and also as a framing device for subsequent chapters. These projects have also played an important role in opening up my design work into an artistic context, as it was on the basis of Ant Ballet (as exhibited at FutureEverything festival in Manchester) that I was offered the residency at the Palais de Tokyo, thereby also redefining the disciplinary scope of my practice.</p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch1/#frames","title":"Frames","text":"<p>The conceptual frame in which a piece of art exists is central to an audiences\u2019 understanding of it. The British cyberneticist Gregory Bateson wrote extensively about the relationship between the way humans mentally construct the world they inhabit and the way they perceive and create cultural phenomena, such as artwork. How do we know to treat art as art, or to separate the fiction in a story from everyday lived experience? Is this ability to separate the fictitious or fantastical from the real an innately human quality, or can it be seen in other animals? And what does this tell us about the way we see art? These questions are posed in Bateson\u2019s essay A Theory of Play and Fantasy, in which he introduces the concept of mental frames.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>Bateson begins the essay with a vignette: while watching moneys play in San Francisco\u2019s Fleischer Zoo, the author wonders how they are able to distinguish between play-fighting and real fighting and poses the question: how does this delineation happen and how is it communicated? Drawing on numerous disciplines, including anthropology, linguistics, semiotics, psychology and the study of animal behaviour, Bateson uses this example as a model to investigate the way in which humans conceptualise and analyse their experiences and thoughts in the real world and decipher meaning from communication.<sup>4</sup> He begins by discussing language. Playing with another individual (as with two monkeys), requires an ability to communicate, but it also requires meta-communication: that is, communication about the communication. In the case of the play-fighting monkeys, the actions they perform clearly mimic the actions of combat, but somehow both monkeys know that this is play fighting, rather than real fighting. For example, the play bite symbolises a real bite, but does not elicit the consequences of the latter. Bateson therefore concludes that playing communicates a message: \u2018these actions in which we engage do not denote what those actions for which they stand denote.\u2019<sup>5</sup> Bateson claims that this is similar to Alfred Korzybski\u2019s famous argument about the relationship between the map and the territory it describes. Korzybski, a scholar in field of general semantics and linguistics, distinguished map and territory as distinct entities, arguing that a map is merely a model of the territory, and thus in being a model, the map becomes a simplified version of the territory:</p> <p>A map is not the territory it represents, but, if correct, it has a similar structure [^original emphasis] to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness. If the map could be ideally correct, it would include, in a reduced scale, the map of the map; the map of the map, of the map; and so on, endlessly [...].<sup>6</sup></p> <p>For Korzybski maps are an analogy for languages, which must \u2018be considered only as maps [^original emphasis]. A word is not the object it represents\u2019.<sup>7</sup> When applied to Bateson\u2019s monkey example, within the game, the monkeys\u2019 play-bites act as signifiers of the bites they would do if it were a real fight. So within the monkeys\u2019 play, the relationship between the actions they are performing and the actions they represent (i.e. play-fighting to real fighting) is akin to the map\u2019s relationship to the territory it represents. The monkeys both know that this fight is a game, and some sort of communication is necessary to enable this to happen. The animals do \u2018not quite mean what they are saying, but, also, they are usually communicating about something that does not exist.\u2019<sup>8</sup></p> <p>Bateson argues that these games also occur in the human realm. In our appreciation of art (among other pursuits), for example, we too have to realise that we are indulging in a form of play, that the symbolic representations contained within the objects we\u2019re looking at are mere representations:</p> <p>At the human level, this leads to a vast variety of complications and inversions in the fields of play, fantasy, and art. Conjurers and painters of the trompe l'oeil school concentrate upon acquiring a virtuosity whose only reward is reached after the viewer detects that he has been deceived and is forced to smile or marvel at the skill of the deceiver. Hollywood film-makers spend millions of dollars to increase the realism of a shadow. Other artists, perhaps more realistically, insist that art be nonrepresentational; and poker players achieve a strange addictive realism by equating the chips for which they play with dollars. They still insist, however, that the loser accept his loss as part of the game.<sup>9</sup></p> <p>In play, the players must be reminded that they are playing. But play contains an internal paradox: there are messages within the message that tell the receiver that the action is play; in other words, that it is untrue. Play must be separated from the \u2018real\u2019 actions it symbolises. This process, Bateson argues, occurs through a \u2018psychological frame\u2019 and \u2018context\u2019.<sup>10</sup></p> <p>What, then, is a frame? Bateson claims that there are two examples that could be used to discuss the analogy: a picture frame, or a mathematical set. For the sake of clarity in this argument, I will only focus on the former. A psychological frame, like a picture frame, is a delimitation device: the frame around a painting marks the outer limits of the artwork, and \u2018tells the viewer that he is not to use the same sort of thinking in interpreting the picture that he might use in interpreting the wallpaper outside the frame.\u2019<sup>11</sup> A similar, but non-physical device can be found in real-world scenarios where we have to \u2018frame\u2019 actions: jobs, plays, interviews and languages all require framing, insofar as behaviour inside these frames is understood to be distinct, and carry different symbolic meaning, to the actions that take place outside of it. A physical picture frame is itself an \u2018excessively concrete\u2019<sup>12</sup> device representing an externalisation of our internal mental processes, since \u2018human beings operate more easily in a universe where some of their psychological characteristics are externalised.\u2019<sup>13</sup></p> <p>Psychological frames (and by extension, picture frames) are both inclusive and exclusive devices. Simultaneously, they act to include certain messages by excluding others, and exclude certain messages by including others. For example, a picture viewer asks the viewer to \u2018attend to what is within and do not attend to what is outside.\u2019<sup>14</sup> Bateson continues:</p> <p>The frame itself thus becomes a part of the premise system. Either, as in the case of the play frame, the frame is involved in the evaluation of the messages which it contains, or the frame merely assists the mind in understanding the contained messages by reminding the thinker that these messages are mutually relevant and the messages outside the frame may be ignored.<sup>15</sup></p> <p>The frame, then, is a \u2018metacommunicative\u2019 device;<sup>16</sup> any message containing a frame \u2018ipso facto gives the receiver instructions or aids in his attempt to understand the messages included within the frame.\u2019<sup>17</sup></p> <p>Bateson\u2019s psychological frame concept contains similarities with Schank and Abelson\u2019s script theory.<sup>18</sup> Schank and Abelson\u2019s scripts are sets of rules which are activated when a person encounters a certain scenario; a number of these scenarios are examples of play (for example, football or squash). Although Schank and Abelson do not explicitly make the point, their concept of a scene requires a Batesonian frame, the imposition of which enables the triggering of scripts. The ability to play through imagined Schank-and-Abelsonian scripts in one\u2019s head (such as imagining an encounter in a restaurant) could be seen as an example of Batesonian framing.</p> <p>Within the world of artistic production, both psychological frames and script theory carry implications: the context within which work is presented, and even the genre the work fits into, much like a physical frame on a wall, delineates the limits and extent within which an artwork or project will be judged; and the script associated with the context \u2013\u00a0in other words the genre of work \u2013\u00a0delineates implicit and explicit rules, norms, and protocols, which are generally followed. Within the world of artistic production, defining the remit and scope of the virtual frame an artist works within is an important determinant of how their work is portrayed, understood and interpreted. Traditional Balinese painting, for example, will be interpreted according to different rules (or scripts) to a Van Gogh.<sup>19</sup> Similarly, work displayed in the context of an art gallery will be interpreted differently to the same work presented in a science museum, by virtue of the psychological frame it uses and the scripted behaviour this elicits .</p> <p>What relevance does an argument about psychological and knowledge frames have in this thesis? This chapter discusses two projects, which were instrumental in defining the scope and frame of the practice I now employ. Both of these projects worked with ants, with the aim of manipulating their behaviour, either as individuals or entire colonies. The development of these projects led to, and helped to shape initial research for this thesis; however, the original framing and exhibition of the Ant Ballet project as \u2018sci-art\u2019 (the meaning of which will be discussed shortly) placed undue emphasis on certain aspects of the project, which in turn undermined its absurd, diagrammatic intentions. This is discussed through a pair of exhibitions, one in which the work was exhibited in a scientific institution, and another where it was exhibited in the context of an art and technology festival.</p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch1/#projects","title":"Projects","text":"Figure 1-6: Ant Ballet signage layout, at ZSL London Zoo, from the installation manual.

The \u2018controller\u2019, the ever-absent Godot, is removed from the situation, leaving the audience feeling as though the characters are puppets, their strings being pulled from afar. It is a portrait of a pair of confused lives subject to abstract controls, with little sense of individual agency.</p> <p>Similarly, there is a scene in George Lucas\u2019 first feature film, the dystopic sci-fi thriller THX-1138, where the main protagonist wakes up to find that he is in a featureless, potentially infinite, white room, and that no matter which direction he walks in, he gets nowhere.<sup>21</sup> Whilst the film as an entirety may be seen as a crude high-tech approximation of George Orwell\u2019s 1984, and a continuation of the escape-from-dystopia plot consistently found in sci-fi, I found the image of the infinite void compelling when I first watched the film in 2009.<sup>22</sup> The sense of despair and helplessness present in both the THX-1138 scene, and Waiting for Godot (as well as the image of Sisyphus in Camus\u2019 The Myth of Sisyphus) was something that I wanted to explore through a machinic diagram.<sup>23</sup> Building a machine that would literally transport a person to a similar state as the aforementioned works of literature and film would not be logistically or financially possible. However, I was mesmerised by the emotional reaction I had to both of these works, and wanted to build something that evoked similar affect from an audience.</p> <p>Engaging with fiction requires the viewer to enter a Batesonian frame; to knowingly realise that the fiction depicted on-screen or in the pages of a novel is fantasy. The same could be said of reading Foucault\u2019s description of Jeremy Bentham\u2019s Panopticon, a design for a prison (or high-surveillance education system), ultimately unrealised during Bentham\u2019s lifetime.<sup>24</sup> Foucault\u2019s initial diagrammatic description of the Panopticon is as follows:</p> <p>We know the principle on which it was based: at the periphery, an annular building; at the centre, a tower; this tower is pierced with wide windows that open onto the inner side of the ring; the peripheric building is divided into cells, each of which extends the whole width of the building; they have two windows, one on the inside, corresponding to the windows of the tower; the other, on the outside, allows the light to cross the cell from one end to the other. All that is needed, then, is to place a supervisor in a central tower and to shut up in each cell a madman, a patient, a condemned man, a worker or a schoolboy. By the effect of backlighting, one can observe from the tower, standing out precisely against the light, the small captive shadows in the cells of the periphery. They are like so many cages, so many small theatres, in which each actor is alone, perfectly individualised and constantly visible. The panoptic mechanism arranges spatial unities that make it possible to see constantly and to recognize immediately. In short, it reverses the principle of the dungeon; or rather of its three functions - to enclose, to deprive of light and to hide - It preserves only the first and eliminates the other two. Full lighting and the eye of a supervisor capture better than darkness, which ultimately protected. Visibility is a trap.<sup>25</sup></p> <p>In Foucault\u2019s analysis, Bentham\u2019s utilitarian diagram exists as a description, which we know is a work of invention. Yet the reader is able to empathise with the various characters, and even picture them residing in the building, via the disembodied frame they construct. The Panopticon then becomes a framed, hypothetical diagram of surveillance and control; it does not exist in the real moment of reading, but its virtual presence takes command. Foucault describes the prison functioning as a \u2018kind of laboratory of power.\u2019<sup>26</sup> I argue that the real power of this hypothetical design lies in the readers\u2019 tendency to construct the design within their own mind and subsequently project it onto themselves through a Batesonian frame. In the same way that Bateson uses Korzybski\u2019s map-territory relation to differentiate between the actions of monkeys play-fighting and the actions that the play-fighting symbolise (i.e. real, violent fighting), there is a difference between reading Foucault\u2019s description of the Panopticon as a model of power, and the functioning of a real-world Panopticon. In a similar fashion, my intention with the Godot Machine project was to construct a machine which functioned as a diagram, a visual representation of a power structure embodied in a medium that would be immediately and viscerally recognised, framed almost as a work of fiction.</p> <p>The concept of the Godot Machine is simple: an ant sits atop a sphere. If it tries to walk forwards, the sphere rotated backwards. If it tries to walk to the right, the sphere rotates to the left. Irrespective of the ant\u2019s attempts to move in any direction, it will always be mechanically rotated to return to the top of its own little world. In order for this to happen, the ant is monitored from above by a camera, which is connected to a computer control system and series of actuators under the sphere, which can in turn rotate it in any direction. The environment the ant is able to see is also carefully controlled, so that the ant can never visually orient itself with regards to the room that the machine is placed in. The project serves as a diagram of Beckett\u2019s Waiting for Godot (hence the project title): no matter what actions the ant takes, it cannot change its fate. This was the first diagrammatic project that I worked on, and a complete technical description of the project development can be found in the appendices.<sup>27</sup></p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch1/#ant-ballet","title":"Ant Ballet","text":"<p>Godot Machine was an absurd<sub>b</sub> machine in the most literal sense. The diagram of power relations was translated into an actual mechanical device, designed to provoke the realisation of the absurd<sub>b</sub> in the viewer. The project development was also relatively linear, whereby multiple versions of a design solution were prototyped, and the most effective solution was eventually chosen. Whilst working on the Godot Machine, I began developing a project entitled Ant Ballet, which explored the less tangible Deleuzian idea of the machine-as-system, via a more complex conceptualisation of the absurd<sub>b</sub> diagram.<sup>28</sup> Godot Machine had analogised the central themes of the Theatre of the Absurd \u2013 namely loss of agency, disorientation and invisible power structures \u2013 via the manipulation of the individual ant.<sup>29</sup> Ant Ballet aimed to take this idea one step further, by controlling a large group of ants by interfering with their internal communication system. Ants are commonly known to form and follow pheromone trails in order to find food.<sup>30</sup> Since the early 1990s, the emergent behaviour demonstrated by this model of communication has fascinated computer scientists to the extent that it has frequently been used as a model for solving complex problems.<sup>31</sup> Inspired by the almost computational logic built within this system, Ant Ballet project used artificial pheromones, made in a laboratory by organic chemists with whom I collaborated, to script the movement of a colony of ants. It did so via a machine that spread ant pheromones across a two-metre diameter \u2018stage\u2019 which acted as a literal theatre of absurd.<sup>32</sup> Details regarding the technical and theoretical development of this project can be found in the appendices.</p> <p>Much of the inspiration for Ant Ballet, and the consultation of scientific experts, was inspired by the film-making technique of Stanley Kubrick: in particular the film Dr. Strangelove (Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb).<sup>33</sup> The film itself is a masterpiece of the absurd, featuring classically absurdist themes: the breakdown of communication systems, an entropic structure, and lack of individual agency.<sup>34</sup> The film was released in 1964, around 15 months after the Cuban Missile Crisis, at a time when the threat of nuclear war was a very real possibility in the minds of many people, and focuses on exactly that subject. In the film, an errant US air-force base commander launches a nuclear attack on Russia which, through a series of mishaps and operational shortcomings, cannot be recalled. Over the course of the film, it is revealed that Russia has secretly built a \u2018doomsday device\u2019 which would trigger the country\u2019s entire nuclear arsenal if any military sites are attacked. In a rare twist for a hit film, it culminates in the nuclear destruction of the world, but it is also full of dark humour. Much like the absurdist works, the actions of characters (and in this case the destruction of the world), are inevitable and unavoidable. It is both absurd<sub>a</sub> and absurd<sub>b</sub>.</p> <p>In the production of the film, Kubrick went to extreme lengths to ensure its technical accuracy. The depictions of numerous protocols, attitudes, and interiors have been deemed accurate by experts in the field.<sup>35</sup> The story itself was developed from a novel by a former Royal Air Force flight lieutenant Peter George, following its personal recommendation to Kubrick by the head of the Institute of Strategic Studies in London, and throughout the making of the film Kubrick read over 50 books and consulted with twelve experts on the subject of thermonuclear war.<sup>36</sup> The viability of the films\u2019 plotline and characters accentuated the absurd<sub>b</sub> nature of the film itself, or rather, its proximity to reality heightened the potency of the absurd<sub>b</sub> realisation among the audience. In the creation of Ant Ballet, I aspired to similar levels of realism: if I were to make an absurd<sub>b</sub> statement, it would be one that was scientifically accurate. Where the Godot Machine employed engineering techniques, Ant Ballet required collaboration with scientists from different disciplines in order to work. Like Kubrick, the intention was not the accurate depiction of scientific realities onscreen, but rather using this medium to express an absurd<sub>b</sub> idea. Although the project depicted a real experiment, a real mechanism, real ants and their real reaction, it could equally be a work of fiction.</p> <p>Ant Ballet culminated in a film and a series of objects, and was the first of my projects to place such an emphasis on narrative structure and performance.<sup>37</sup> Once I had completed the experiment in Barcelona (where the necessary species of ant colony could be found), and used this to create a film, the project was exhibited at various places. The first exhibition outside of UCL, which took place after my MArch, was at the Zoological Society London (ZSL) London Zoo;<sup>38</sup> here, lacking the ability to use real ants (for the same reasons that the experiment was completed in Barcelona \u2013 see the appendices), the installation consisted of a simulated version of ant movement, adapted from the ant simulation software I had already programmed as part of the experiment, projected onto a white table-top, with a robotic arm \u2018spreading\u2019 pheromones onto the table. The chassis of the original Ant Ballet machine was used, but with a newly-made table surface, light ring and robotic arm. Virtual ants would form trails, and the arm would \u2018spread\u2019 virtual disruptive pheromones (the effect of which could be seen in the projected image), and the ants would disperse, only to lay new pheromone trails over time. At the edge of London Zoo\u2019s BUGS building, beside a bright floor-to-ceiling window, the installation was housed in a dark tent, lined with theatrical blackout fabric, with three viewing holes.<sup>39</sup> The table, two metres in diameter, had approximately one metre of clearance to the side of the tent, and the audience had to get close to the viewing holes in order to see inside (Figure 1-7). The film was projected onto the side of the tent, whilst inside and around it, signs explained both the function of the machine, and scientific knowledge about ant behaviour. Part of the terms of an installation in the Zoo was that it had to be educational, and highlight the conservation work that ZSL\u2019s scientists do; therefore the information was designed to be easily understood by a young audience, and was light and friendly in tone.</p> Figure 1-7: Ant Ballet installation in ZSL London Zoo BUGS building, November 2011 to May 2012. Photograph by the author. <p>The presentation of the project in this manner had a problematic impact on its public reception as an artwork: whilst the work itself (as captured in film and later print) succeeded in embodying an absurd diagram, this specific manifestation of the project did not.<sup>40</sup> The absurd nature of the project, its diagrammatic qualities, and its inherent humour, were all lost beneath the veneer of educational entertainment.<sup>41</sup> The reason is simple: although the project was produced in collaboration with scientists, in this particular presentation, the artistic intention became subservient to the scientific aspect. This was exacerbated by the inability to include real ants, in a setting that was directly opposite a live leaf-cutter ant exhibit. Visitors had the expectation of seeing live animals, and therefore, rather than being viewed a diagrammatic work of art, my installation was an underwhelming addition to an engaging zoological experience. Within the artistic context, the scientific nature of this project (both in terms of its collaborative aspect \u2013 with a team of organic chemists at UCL \u2013 and with regards to its setting at ZSL) led to the framing of the project in terms of \u2018sci-art\u2019. However, this was not my original intention: my goal had been to produce an absurd machine, which involved scientific collaboration, rather than a scientific collaboration whereby the outcome happened to be absurd.</p> <p>The problematic relationship between art and science in \u2018interdisciplinary\u2019 projects has been subject to scrutiny by authors Georgina Born and Andrew Barry in a number of reports.<sup>42</sup> In Art-Science, Born and Barry define the \u2018emergent field of art-science\u2019 as \u2018part of a heterogeneous space of overlapping interdisciplinary practices at the intersection of the arts, sciences and technologies.\u2019<sup>43</sup> The sci-art field has gained prominence in recent years with a number of bodies established to fund projects involving artist-scientist collaboration: the Wellcome Trust has been a major funding source for such projects since its \u2018Sciart\u2019 programme was founded in 1996; the Sciart Consortium was formed in 1999 (joining the Wellcome Trust with \u2018Arts Council England, the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts, the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, the Scottish Arts Council and the British Council\u2019); and in 2003 Arts Council England and the Arts and Humanities Research Council formed the Arts and Science Research Fellowship programme.<sup>44</sup> These organisations implicitly (and sometimes explicitly) refer to a perceived chasm between the arts and the sciences as a rationale for their existence. This idea was identified and explicated in C.P. Snow\u2019s famous Two Cultures lecture of 1959, which remains influential to this day.<sup>45</sup> Snow argues:</p> <p>There seems then to be no place where the cultures meet. I am not going to waste time saying that this is a pity. It is much worse than that. Soon I shall come to some practical consequences. But at the heart of thought and creation we are letting some of our best chances go by default. The clashing point of two subjects, two disciplines, two cultures\u2014of two galaxies, so far as that goes\u2014 ought to produce creative chances. In the history of mental activity that has been where some of the break-throughs came. The chances are there now. But they are there, as it were, in a vacuum, because those in the two cultures can't talk to each other. It is bizarre how very little of twentieth-century science has been assimilated into twentieth-century art.<sup>46</sup></p> <p>While Snow\u2019s thesis calls for a bridging of the disciplines in order to forge new forms of knowledge, the benefits he outlines are distinctly scientific or technical, as opposed to artistic. Snow was seeking technical solutions to large-scale problems of his day (population growth, the Cold War, income inequality) through merging of disciplines, yet in doing so, he insinuates that art only obtains validation in the broader societal realm when it brings functional knowledge to society. This observation about the perceived process of artistic legitimisation that is seen to underpin sci-art collaborations is a starting point for both Born and Barry in Art-science and Paul Glinkowski and Anne Bamford in their analysis of the Wellcome Trust\u2019s Sciart programme.<sup>47</sup> As Barry et al. explain, similar attitudes are expressed in contemporary sci-art funding:</p> <p>One of the key justifications for funding art-science, particularly in the UK, has been the notion that the arts can provide a service to science, rendering it more popular or accessible to the lay public or publicising and enhancing the aesthetic aspects of scientific imagery.<sup>48</sup></p> <p>This is exemplified by the Wellcome Trust\u2019s funding, which is \u2018explicitly intended to bridge the two cultures by enlisting artists to foster the public\u2019s relationship with science.\u2019<sup>49</sup> As Glinkowski and Bamford state:</p> <p>Working alongside the arts had helped to make science more accessible to the public, and had thus improved scientific communication. It was suggested that artists had, in some cases, helped to improve a perceived \u2018image problem\u2019 ascribed to scientists and to the scientific profession. [...] Artists working on [^Wellcome Trust-funded] Sciart projects were felt to have acted as a proxy for the public, opening up scientific practices to a wider gaze. By bringing into the public domain new perspectives on the work that was being conducted in laboratories and other places of science, it was suggested that artists were, in effect, acting as the \u2018public\u2019s representative\u2019. A significant aspect of the artists\u2019 contribution to \u2018public engagement with science\u2019 was thus as independent scrutinisers \u2013 asking questions and provoking insights that might not otherwise be possible, either from the perspective of the general public or from within the scientific community itself.<sup>50</sup></p> <p>Acting in this manner, art becomes a mouth-piece of science; a method of communicating scientific knowledge over artistic expression. The Ant Ballet installation in London Zoo exemplified this relationship; the diagrammatic absurdity of the project was a secondary message to the valid scientific knowledge that could be imparted to the public. It was disappointing to see the original artistic intention of the work diluted to this extent. However, this experience proved to be incredibly valuable as it exposed the impact that framing can have on the perception of an artwork, and prompted me to re-establish and theorise the original intention behind the project.. Presenting this particular project as sci-art, in a venue associated more with education than artistic expression, created a frame within which a public will only focus on the science. Within this environment, artistic content merely becomes a series of aesthetic choices through which science is communicated.</p> <p>However, the potential of science-art collaborations is not limited to this imbalanced relationship model. Born and Barry argue that there is potential for new modes of knowledge that do not subjugate one discipline below the other:</p> <p>We propose that art-science should be understood as a multiplicity, and that part of its interest lies in not being reducible to the imperative to render scientific knowledge more accessible or accountable. Indeed art-science poses definitional and conceptual challenges since, while it exists as a practical, intentional category for artists and scientists, cultural institutions and funding bodies, it forms part of a larger, heterogeneous space of overlapping interdisciplinary practices at the intersection of the arts, sciences and technologies \u2013 including new media art and digital art, interactive art and bio-art [...] while these domains abut adjacent interdisciplinary scientific and technological fields from robotics, informatics, artificial and embodied intelligence to tissue engineering and systems biology. There is thus a great deal of activity but little codification; \u2018art-science\u2019 amounts to a pool of shifting practices and categories that are themselves relational and in formation.<sup>51</sup></p> <p>Fortunately, I was able to re-frame the project shortly after the London Zoo installation in a way that resisted the \u2018codification\u2019 Born and Barry highlight. In May 2012, I produced an installation for the FutureEverything festival in Manchester.<sup>52</sup> I had first made contact with FutureEverything a few years previously, when a project I had worked on received a runner-up prize at their inaugural awards.<sup>53</sup> The festival itself has a broad remit, and has grown from being an avant-garde music festival (entitled FutureSonic, established in 1996) to being at the forefront of critical questions in technology, staging an art exhibition and conference alongside a series of music and film events in and around Manchester.<sup>54</sup> The festival featured artists working in disparate genres but united by their engagement with technology, attracting an audience consisting of the general public, as well as media and technology specialists (MediaCity, the main BBC studios in the North of England, and Granada Studios are both located nearby). Having realised the issues with the \u2018framing\u2019 of Ant Ballet as at the Zoo, I worked with FutureEverything\u2019s curation team to ensure that the project itself would be presented with the emphasis on artistic intention.<sup>55</sup> I made three new films and built a new, aesthetically simplified version of the machine.<sup>56</sup></p> Figure 1-8: CNC manufacturing and test assembling the machine for the FutureEverything exhibition at the Bartlett, April 2012. Photographs by the author. <p>The exhibition took place on the top floor of the 1830 Warehouse, a Grade I-listed building within the Science Museum\u2019s Museum of Science and Industry. The historic setting created several logistical challenges, as artists were prohibited from mounting works that could potentially damage or alter the building in the process of installation (such as screws). The space consisted of four large projected films along one wall, each approximately 2.5m wide, with a round machine, 2m in diameter, suspended approximately half a metre above the floor in the middle of the room. The machine was a specially-made maquette of the original Ant Ballet machine (as used in the original Barcelona experiment and at London Zoo), but aesthetically simplified so that it appeared to be merely a white floating surface, with a robotic arm which would only become visible when it was disrupting the virtual ant trails. The robotic arm itself was minimalist, consisting of black aluminium tubular rods, servos and bespoke 3D-printed nylon connectors. At the end of the arm, the pheromone-spreading actuator, instead of being a replica of the real pheromone spreaders, was a conductors\u2019 rod. The simulation showed virtual ants, each a white pixel, moving on the surface of the machine and laying and optimising green trails. When the machine \u2018activated\u2019, a spotlight would illuminate the conductors\u2019 wand, which would tap and distribute virtual pheromones. The ants\u2019 behaviour could instantly be seen on the table: the well-formed trails would break apart, the pheromones would evaporate and disappear, and the ants would begin again. The conductors\u2019 wand would operate once every few minutes \u2013 enough that the ants could effectively recuperate, and that a casual audience member would have enough time to observe both the formation of \u2018natural\u2019 trails and the disruption of the trails by the machine. The machine also dispensed with the Dr. Strangelove-inspired light-ring that was used in the original machine and its London Zoo counterpart, instead using the high-powered projector suspended above to illuminate the table surface, and the arm when the machine was activated.</p> Figure 1-9: Ant Ballet installation at 1830 Warehouse, Manchester, for the FutureEverything Festival, May 2012. Photograph \u00a9 Tape Ltd. (Jan and Emily Dixon) <p>Across the four screens, four films played on looped projections. Whilst each film was not playing, its screen would be illuminated in a pastel colour with a one-word title such as \u2018Making\u2019 or \u2018Info\u2019.<sup>57</sup> The screens were inspired by interface monitors from Kubrick\u2019s film 2001: A Space Odyssey (in which the an entropic plotline and breakdown in communications emulate the absurdist overtones of Dr Strangelove) and featured similar graphics, animation, and sparse wording to those on the fictional space-ship controlled by the computer HAL (I had visited the Kubrick Archives to investigate how the original interfaces had been animated).<sup>58</sup> Each film presented an aspect of the project: the first focused on control, and the emergent properties of pheromone trails as opposed to hierarchical control systems; the second presented infographics which explained the ant movements; the third focused on the making of the project; and the final film was documentation of the Barcelona experiment and the only video with sound. The intention behind this arrangement was to highlight the referential and diagrammatic nature of the installation. The Barcelona film referred back to the original experiment, but played its 90 second loop only once every three minutes; the three silent films, on the other hand, were made intentionally to explain and emphasise the machine in the centre of the room as a simulation of ant behaviour, rather than a mere copy of the initial scientific experiment. In other words, the installation emphasised the absurd idea underpinning the project, rather than the scientific specifics of the ant experiment: the machine was presented as a map to the territory of the real machine. Unlike in the ZSL exhibition, FutureEverything gave me the opportunity to highlight the absurdist and metaphorical aspects of the project by distancing the work from the live insects, and therefore repositioned the scientific aspect as a complimentary, rather than dominant, facet of the artistic practice.</p> Figure 1-10: Ant Ballet installation at 1830 Warehouse, Manchester, for the FutureEverything Festival, May 2012. Photograph \u00a9 Tape Ltd. (Jan and Emily Dixon) <p>I spent time in the opening week of the exhibition observing how the audience engaged with the machine and the films. The installation was the first \u2018room\u2019 in the gallery, and the layout drew people through the space. Most spent around 3-5 minutes watching films \u2013 some flitted between films and machine, whilst others worked their way through the films sequentially. The sparse timing of the pheromone-releasing machine created a spectacle every time it activated, and the machine itself was often a hub around which the audience gathered (even whilst watching the screens). There were numerous factors which made this installation a success in contrast to its earlier exhibition. The sheer amount of space, the ability to frame the messages the project conveyed, and effectively choreograph an audiences\u2019 movement through the room through the interplay of films and machine, all played a role.</p> <p>The project also garnered media attention. The day after the exhibition launched, I was interviewed by BBC News, as well as Brazilian and Iranian television networks, and national magazines, and the project was featured on numerous blogs worldwide.<sup>59</sup> Whilst such media attention is not by any means an indicator of the quality of work, the role it plays in promotion of an artist cannot be underestimated. The spreading of Ant Ballet (and in particular the projects\u2019 main video) via the internet led directly to later commissions, including the residency at the Palais de Tokyo which enabled other projects in this thesis (Scriptych, 86400, 24fps Psycho, Network / Intersect) to take place.</p> Figure 1-11: Ant Ballet photoshoot for Wired Magazine, Battersea. August 2012. Photo \u00a9 Michael Blann / Cond\u00e9 Nast Inc. <p>Before I began the PhD thesis, I had intended to continue working on the Ant Ballet project, refining the design, developing the technical and theoretical aspects in order to create multiple permutations and iterations of the machines, and create performances, installations and films of the same theme. During the initial months of my thesis research, I worked on a project with my collaborator Dr. Sumner in which I built technical equipment to test whether British garden ants (Lasius niger) are attracted to electricity, as has been anecdotally reported, which was then tested in a study at the Institute of Zoology by an undergraduate student. It was through careful analysis of my experiences in this project, as well as the failed and successful installations, which led me to realise my earlier arguments about the importance of the frame. I took the conscious decision to move away from the field of sci-art for the next few projects in order that I could focus on the creation of absurd diagrams.</p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch1/#chapter-conclusion","title":"Chapter Conclusion","text":"<p>In this chapter, I have discussed the development of two projects, and the role that framing has on the perception of work. I have argued that in the case of Ant Ballet, the sci-art moniker (and its associated terms) was not useful in framing the project, leading to the creation of an unsuccessful installation at London Zoo. The specific relationship between science and art within Sci-art practice can, of course, exist in multiple permutations. As has been discussed, Born and Barry highlight three modes as being particularly prevalent.<sup>60</sup> The first, refers to the appropriation of scientific knowledge to justify artistic production. Closely related to this is the second permutation, involving the production of artwork whereby the intention is to communicate pre-existing scientific knowledge: \u2018Science is conceived as finished or complete, and as needing only to be communicated, understood or applied, while art provides the means through which the public is mobilized or stimulated on behalf of science.\u2019<sup>61</sup> This latter is an approach I strongly disagree with and have tried to avoid in my own work. Science is a continuum of knowledge, formed through consensus and continual posing of theories.<sup>62</sup> As Kuhn has described it, normal science is a \u2018puzzle-solving\u2019 activity, one which establishes myriad smaller problems to be solved in order to get closer to proof of a larger theory.<sup>63</sup> Scientific knowledge is not always agreed upon: \u2018History suggests that the road to a firm research consensus is extraordinarily arduous.\u2019<sup>64</sup></p> <p>The third mode of science-art partnership, which is strongly advocated by Born and Barry, denotes a mode of collaboration that instigates the generation of a new form of knowledge . They cite the work of Barbara Cassin and Hannah Arendt to claim that this mode of art-science practice could produce knowledge that is different from either discipline. Art-science, as they see it, is a public experiment, which they define using the Greek term epidexis: \u2018the art of \u201cshowing\u201d (deiknumi) \u201cin front\u201d (epi), in the presence of a public, to make a show.\u2019<sup>65</sup> They explain:</p> <p>As a form of epideixis, public experiments do not so much present existing scientific knowledge to the public, as forge relations between new knowledge, things, locations and persons that did not exist before \u2013 in this way producing truth, public, and their relation at the same time.<sup>66</sup></p> <p>Whilst Ant Ballet, being created with an absurd diagram in mind, and acting through performance itself, may fit into this category of work, I believe it is actually closer to the work of Kubrick in Dr. Strangelove. The project is an artwork, displayed in a performative manner to the public, which uses scientific knowledge, experts, and methodologies to convey an absurd diagram to a public. First and foremost in the project lies the absurd intention; the fact that the project uses scientific methods, necessitating collaboration with scientists, should not change this. Far from weakening the project, or the nature of the collaboration itself, not defining the work as \u2018sci-art\u2019 enables the interested observer to find out more about the project if they desire (through publications such as New Scientist or Bio Art: Altered Realities),<sup>67</sup> or engage with the work as it was intended.</p> <p>This argument is exemplified in the Jorge Luis Borges short story On Exactitude in Science, in which an empire becomes so obsessed with cartography that it builds a 1:1 map of its territory; the map is useless, and ends up a tattered historical relic.

In the previous chapter, I described two projects which relied heavily on computer scripting: Ant Ballet used an inverse-kinematics programme to drive its robot arm and spread pheromones; the Godot Machine used a programme which used computer vision to drive the movement of a ball.<sup>1</sup> Chapter 3 introduces two projects where I used scripting to generate new films, 86400 and 24fps Psycho from archival footage.<sup>2</sup> I regard the act of writing code itself a design process: it requires a mode of thought that is procedural and concentrated; it is distinct from drawing, yet offers a similarly iterative process of refinement and improvement. This chapter will discuss the way in which designers, and in particular I, think about code and think in code. It begins with an introduction to principles of code writing, and a couple of precedents of diagramming code used by Italo Calvino and Alan Turing. It then presents two projects that form part of my research and design portfolio as part of this PhD, both of which use different principles and methodologies to frame a conversation about thinking about code.</p> <p>My introduction to writing code (besides playing around with website creation in the early 2000s) came when I joined the Bartlett. I took a series of classes in the Interactive Architecture Lab which introduced me to two languages which I would then use for almost every project for the next few years: Processing and Arduino. Both languages are open-source, and were specifically written to enable artists and designers easy access to higher-level computer compiling languages and microcontrollers. Both also call their files \u2018sketches\u2019 \u2013\u00a0a tactical decision which both unites digital and analogue practices. The \u2018sketch\u2019 (rather than, say, file, script, document, or programme) contains clear implicit meaning: firstly, that code itself need not be daunting, and writing a prototypical piece of code should be as natural as drawing on paper. Secondly, the nomenclature aims to position writing code squarely into the early stages of design process, rather than being an extra thing to think about after the designing is done. Both languages offer exactly the promises Oosterhout described in his article on scripting, and these languages acted as a bridging tool for me to learn more advanced modes of programming.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>The form of integrated coding I experienced at the Bartlett seems to reflect the pedagogical practices I have witnessed first-hand at several other design schools over the past few years. Today, it is not uncommon to see parametric scripting, small electronic prototypes, applications and websites, or other various coded outcomes to student projects.<sup>4</sup> As discussed in the introduction to this thesis, some teaching methods relating to particular aspects of scripting culture, namely parametricist design practice, are highly exclusionary, and rely on rote copying-and-pasting of code examples, or rely extensively on particular libraries and algorithms which are then unquestioningly repeated.<sup>5</sup> But other aspects of the computer-scripting world are relatively easy to inhabit as an autodidact; there are numerous tutorials, example files, libraries, forums, and so on online which can be used to extend pre-existing skills. My own entry to coding was via classes at the Bartlett, but once I knew the basics of a couple of languages, and knew where to look, and what to look for, extending my vocabulary and skillset was simply a matter of investing time. The approach I have to writing code is different to the traditional computer programmer, for whom the aim is often to write lean, efficient code (often for someone else) which performs to the highest standard; my intention is to use code and code-based-thought to investigate, to learn, or to express design intent.</p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch2/#code-writing-and-code-thinking","title":"Code writing and code thinking","text":"<p>In most instances, before I write code, I use a number of diagrammatic techniques to work out what I want the code do. These could be in the form of state transition diagrams, pseudo-code, flow charts, or diagrams of code-based \u2018mechanisms\u2019, with labelled inputs, outputs and procedures.<sup>6</sup> These diagrams are functional sketches; they show a potential solution to some form of data processing. Like working sketches, they are often altered, improved upon, or superseded later in the design process. Their function is to enable me to mentally model what is going to be happening within the computer itself, to interrogate the logic and data-flows, and make improvements before the functions are obfuscated by interdependent lines of code written in a specific language.</p> <p>Although arguably becoming more central to certain designers\u2019 process, writing code does require modes of practice that are in themselves distinct from other design processes. Code is written in code language, and like spoken languages, code languages require learning, practice and often an attitudinal change with regards to the way in which things are done. Communities of people who write code are often tribe-line in their allegiance, and code languages tend to impose a mode of working that cause them to be particularly suited to certain ways of working. PHP, a scripting language used primarily on websites, for example, is notorious for quick development (although lamented by many computer programmers for being \u2018dirty\u2019);<sup>7</sup> Python and its associated communities pride themselves on the Zen of Python and use terms such as \u2018pythonic\u2019 to describe best practice when writing in the language.<sup>8</sup></p> <p>The essential process that one enters when diagramming a computer programme is the mental modelling of the programme they are going to write. In essence, one must think as a computer; to understand how at each step the programme will store, retrieve and manipulate symbols, variables, and objects. To draw a linguistic analogy, we might think about the difference between having and being in English and Spanish. In English, we draw no grammatical distinction between the state of being implicit in human gender, age, activity, or state of sensing (e.g. warm/cold). However, in Spanish, each of these attributes is approached differently:</p> <p></p> English Spanish Spanish-English translation I am a man Soy uno hermano I am [in the long-term] a man I am thirty years old Tengo trienta a\u00f1os I have thirty years I am writing Estoy escribiendo I am [in this moment] writing I am a designer Soy un dise\u00f1ador I am [permanently] a designer I am cold Tengo frio I have cold I have a headache Me duele la cabeza It hurts my head Table 2-2:  English / Spanish translations. Source: the author. <p>Whilst in both English and Spanish, the solution to being (or having) cold may be to turn the radiator up, the effect of the temperature rise is expressed differently; in English, it refers to a stat of being (I am cold) and in Spanish the state of being is expressed through a possessed attribute (Tengo frio: I have cold). The presence of temporary and permanent states of being (e.g. estoy / soy) make the quick articulation of a vocation, as opposed to a temporary task, a simple verbal substitution, whereas in English, this would be declared or implied through context. This is a similar nuance to differing modes of computer programming: the object-oriented programmer may create a class of objects that store a variable for coldness (the equivalent of being cold), whereas another programming language may create a series of objects where \u2018coldness\u2019 is a secondary, external variable (the equivalent of having cold). Another may invoke coldness as a state. The differences in the handling of virtual objects, the changing of states and attributes, and the order in which things are processed, all contribute to the utility of a language at certain tasks.</p> <p>Much of the time in my own practice, I use flow-charts, draw data flows, and write pseudo-code to work out the effect I would like my programme to have. This then allows me to put \u2018sample data\u2019 through the virtual programme and see the effect. For example, here is a sample piece of pseudo-code for a thermostat, designed to run continuously:</p> <pre><code>Turning the radiator ON for 5 SECONDS increases the temperature by 1\u00ba.\nLeaving the radiator OFF for 30 SECONDS decreases the temperature by 1\u00ba.\n\nEvery 5 SECONDS, read TEMPERATURE:\n- If TEMPERATURE less than TARGET, switch radiator ON.\n- If TEMPERATURE larger than or equal to TARGET, switch radiator OFF.\n</code></pre> <p>I would then \u2018run\u2019 this code several times on paper, writing down different starting temperatures, and the results as I went along.<sup>9</sup> Once I was happy that the pseudo-code would deliver my desired results, I would then turn this into real code (the following to be run in Python):</p> <pre><code>target = 18\ncurrentTemp = getTemp()\n\nif (currentTemp &lt; target):\n  radiator = 1\nelse:\n  radiator = 0\n</code></pre> <p>This process is not unusual for a programmer. Pseudo-code and flowcharts formed part of my first code lessons; the methodology is rife online, and anecdotally, every programmer I have spoken to about the subject uses some form of pseudo-coding if they are mounting a complex task.</p> <p>Another well-known pseudo-coder was Italo Calvino. As discussed in this thesis\u2019 introduction, Calvino was a member of the Oulipo and active experimenter with combinatorial forms of story-writing. Calvino described his early theories of combinatorial writing in his 1967 lecture Cybernetics and Ghosts.<sup>10</sup> Alluding the theory of DNA, which enables \u2018the endless variety of living forms\u2019 to be \u2018reduced to a combination of certain finite quantities\u2019, he turns the same logic to linguistics:<sup>11</sup></p> <p>Here again, it is information theory that imposes its patterns. The processes that appeared most resistant to a formulation on terms of number, to a quantitative description, are not translated into mathematical patterns.<sup>12</sup></p> <p>This is perhaps most exemplified with the story the Burning of the Abominable House.<sup>13</sup> In writing this story, which was in itself based on combinatory principles, Calvino effectively became the computer, running his pseudo-code instructions line by line to create enough possible permutations to tell the story. His widow, Esther Calvino, recounts:</p> <p>There had been a somewhat vague request from IBM: how far was it possible to write a story using the computer? This was in 1973 in Paris when it wasn\u2019t easy to gain access to data processing equipment. Undaunted, Calvino gave the project a Calvino gave the project a great deal of his time, carrying out all of the operations himself. The story was finally published in the Italian edition of Playboy. Calvino didn\u2019t really feel this was a problem, although he had originally planned for it to be published in Oulipo as an example of ars combinatoria and a challenge to his own mathematical abilities.<sup>14</sup></p> <p>The expense of computers did not just create human-computers of Italian writers in the 1970s. Alan Turing, whose 1936 paper On computable numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem set forth the concept of the universal computing machine (the basis of every modern computer), and whose pioneering work developing early computers led to the cracking of the Enigma code (shortening WWII by several years), was himself unable to access a computer in 1951 whilst trying to write a programme that enabled a digital computer to play chess.<sup>15</sup> Turing was convinced that programming computers to solve complex problems such as playing chess would yield unexpected advances in other sectors:</p> <p>Research into the techniques of programming may in fact lead to quite important advances, and help in serious business and economics \u2013\u00a0perhaps, regrettably, even in the theory of war[^.]<sup>16</sup></p> <p>His first attempts at writing a chess programme were on paper, without computer, and he tested them by playing friends and secretaries \u2013\u00a0with Turing playing the role of computer himself, running through the algorithms for each move.<sup>17</sup> Turing used the concept of computers playing chess to argue the following principle:</p> <p>If one can explain quite unambiguously in English, with the aid of mathematical symbols if required, how a calculation is to be done, then it is always possible to programme any digital computer to do that calculation, provided the storage capacity is adequate.<sup>18</sup></p> <p>The idea of becoming a human computer to complete complex mathematical tasks seems absurd<sub>a</sub> today, when so much of our contemporary calculation is done via digital computers. It would seem even more absurd<sub>a</sub> if the person doing the computing is a famous author or one of the originators of computers themselves. But as both Nancy Katherine Hayles and David Allen Grier note, human computers (a job predominantly performed by women),\u00a0were commonplace in the 1930s and 40s.<sup>19</sup> Carrying out large, often mundane calculations required that banks of women may work together on separate parts of the same task.<sup>20</sup> It is only in 1946, after the pioneering work of John von Nuemann and Alan Turing, that the term came to mean a non-human device which would calculate. The first OED citation of term \u2018computer\u2019 is in fact from 1613, and refers to a person who makes calculations. Grier claims that \u2018the start of large-scale scientific research\u2019 now \u2018known informally as \u201cbig science\u201d\u2019 can be \u2018traced to the [^human] computing offices of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\u2019<sup>21</sup></p> <p>Today, however, digital computation is increasingly ubiquitous. \u2018Cloud-based\u2019 computing, \u2018internet of things\u2019, smartphones, and digital assistants such as Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa have all emerged in the past few years, and all bear the promise of extending the reach of computation.<sup>22</sup> The systems behind Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa in particular are marketed as making use of artificial intelligence and/or machine learning, two widely used terms that are now even commonly found in tabloid news headlines.<sup>23</sup> Many large-scale consumer technology companies (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and more) are investing in artificial intelligence research;<sup>24</sup> machine learning is also at the heart of emerging self-piloting technologies such self-driving cars and delivery drones.<sup>25</sup> The recent boom in artificial intelligence is not the first; theoretical and practical research in the field has been carried out for at least fifty years. An earlier boom in research in the late 1970s and early 1980s was in part fuelled by researchers such as Minsky, and Schank and Abelson; the subject was so prevalent in the public consciousness that in 1984, the BBC commissioned philosopher John Searle to give their annual Reith Lectures on advances in computing, artificial intelligence, and their potential philosophical ramifications.<sup>26</sup></p> <p>Searle is best known for his Chinese Room argument, which is a \u2018refutation of strong artificial intelligence.\u2019<sup>27</sup> Introduced in a paper entitled Minds, Brains, and Programs in 1980, the debate around the implications and validity of the argument still reins today.<sup>28</sup> The argument was originally posed as a response to researchers such as Schank and Abelson, who advocated that artificial intelligence programmes which could make use of linguistic scene-recognition would in some way be able to express understanding of scenes;<sup>29</sup> Searle advocates strongly against this viewpoint, arguing that computers will never be able to understand in the way that humans do, even if they can pass the Turing Test.<sup>30</sup> Searle summarises the argument concisely as follows:</p> <p>Imagine a native English speaker, let\u2019s say a man, who knows no Chinese locked in a room full of boxes of Chinese symbols (a data base) together with a book of instructions for manipulating the symbols (the program). Imagine that people outside the room send in other Chinese symbols which, unknown to the person in the room, are questions in Chinese (the input). And imagine that by following the instructions in the program the man in the room is able to pass out Chinese symbols that are correct answers to the questions (the output). The program enables the person in the room to pass the Turing test for understanding Chinese, but he does not understand a word of Chinese.</p> <p>The point of the argument is this: if the man in the room does not understand Chinese on the basis of implementing the appropriate program for understanding Chinese, then neither does any other digital computer solely on that basis because no computer, qua computer, has anything the man does not have.<sup>31</sup></p> <p>I was drawn to the Chinese Room argument due to its inherently analogue reasoning about the nature of artificial intelligence (the metaphor does not rely on a digital computer per se), and the implicit spatial and performative nature of the images elicited by Searle\u2019s description. Through a diagram, purely described in language, Searle is able to make a rational, yet performative argument which challenges pre-existing notions about concepts such as mind and cognition.<sup>32</sup> Nybble is a project I developed which sought to make explicit the diagram Searle described through the participation of a bank of distinctly non-digital human computers blindly following instruction. It was performed in a digital festival in 2013. Three years later, Scriptych was a project which employed machine learning techniques to create a new mode of interaction with a computer database, using spatial metaphors to think about multi-dimensional data structures. It was performed in the entrance to the Opera Garnier in Paris, by dancers from the Opera\u00a0\u2013 an area not traditionally used for the company\u2019s performances. Both projects made use of dancers and were performances, and both did not make a traditional computer interface (i.e. screen) visible.</p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch2/#nybble","title":"Nybble","text":"Figure 2-13:  Nybble performance at the V&amp;A Museum, September 2013. Photo by Danielle Willkens. <p>In June 2013 I was an exhibitor in the V&amp;A Museum\u2019s Digital Design Weekend. This annual celebration, which I had first attended in 2009, coincided with the final weekend of London Design Festival, in which the V&amp;A were also participants. As such, it attracted large amounts of people interested in both digital culture and design. I was approached by the Digital Programmes Manager, Irini Papadimitriou, with whom I discussed creating a new piece of work to engage people with the concepts surrounding computation, rather than showcasing a new piece of computational artwork. Earlier that year, and completely independently, I had been a participant in a workshop run by an Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) research consortium between the V&amp;A Museum and UCL\u2019s Centre for Sustainable Heritage entitled Design with Heritage (DwH). The consortium\u2019s aim was to investigate potential ways in which new and emerging technology could be used to enhance and augment exhibitions and artefacts within museums, and their working method was to gather industry professionals and independent practitioners together in intensive one-day workshops to rapidly identify and propose projects to investigate issues surrounding two topics: potential new methods in which existing and emerging technology could be used to enhance and augment exhibitions and artefacts within museums. I was fortunate to be awarded a small grant to investigate audience navigation in museums, which was used to produce the project that became Nybble.</p> <p>At the time, the concept of artificial intelligence and machine learning was re-entering the public consciousness, and more media coverage was devoted to the subject. I had recently heard about Turing\u2019s chess programme and began my engagement in issues surrounding machine learning and artificial intelligence.<sup>33</sup> I had also taught students computer programming and electronics via Arduino and Processing, and consistently found that students who were otherwise well-versed in using computers for advanced design purposes were often ill-able to describe the underlying principles of computing, or the lineage of technological and philosophical development which had led to the computers we use every day. It seemed that there was a widespread misconception about what a computer is and does; the focus in media representation of technology is often concerned with the form factor technology adopts (e.g. the specifications and aesthetics of a new gadget) rather than the wider ramifications of what it can do, and how this affects society. Turing\u2019s influential papers on computation, and even his early experiments with chess programmes, and even Searle\u2019s arguments about artificial intelligence, had been conducted without the use of a computer, yet the work of both continues to resonate today. I wanted to create a work Digital Design Weekend where computation was on display, but a digital computer was not.</p> <p>I decided that an exhibition whereby a bank of humans could act out the inner workings of a computer, much like Calvino and Turing had done, would be an interesting way to present computation. The humans would form part of a huge computer, calculating something that only an audience would see; thus, the human computers inside the installation, would be acting out Searle\u2019s Chinese Room argument. This would be a larger-scale version of the type of diagramming that I had previously attempted with the Godot Machine and Ant Ballet. The performance would also extend my work into the world of the Absurd, though through an inversion of the traditional Absurdist performance; if the absurd<sub>b</sub> is constructed through an ultimately doomed quest to find meaning in a universe devoid of it (in theatre, usually occurring through an initial establishment of normalcy followed by an entropic descent into meaninglessness), this piece would appear devoid of meaning for its performers and audience without a \u2018key\u2019, yet deliver an arbitrary message to those determined enough to persist and try to crack the code.</p> <p>This structure was influenced by the arguably absurd<sub>b</sub> 1959 novel the The Sirens of Titan by Kurt Vonnegut.<sup>34</sup> The punch-line of the sci-fi story is that the whole of humanity\u2019s development and progress \u2013 technology, languages, religions, and culture \u2013 have in fact been mysteriously influenced by forces from afar, in order that an elaborate and highly specific life-trajectory would be taken by one man, resulting in war on earth and mass destruction \u2013\u00a0all so that one small part of a broken machine on Mars would be replaced, enabling it to continue its journey across the universe to deliver a message. Finally, it is revealed that the message itself consists of a single point, meaning \u2018Greetings\u2019 in its native language.<sup>35</sup> Although smaller in scale, and notably devoid of conspiracy theory-paranoia, this project would ask audience and participants to decode something that tested the limits of their perception (and patience), yet itself conveyed a meaningless message, echoing the absurd<sub>b</sub> assertion that humanity is doomed to search for meaning in a universe devoid of it. Many of the concepts surrounding this idea were the result of conversations with colleagues in who shared a studio, co-tutors, my PhD supervisors, and my frequent collaborator, Abi Palmer.</p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch2/#methodology","title":"Methodology","text":"<p>Please note, for the sake of clarity, the project is presented here in thematic, rather than strictly chronological order. Much of the project development, as with most projects I work on, occurred concurrently as a result of the design process.</p> <p>Early on in the design process, I began researching the mechanics of computation. The part of a computer that is most similar to the process that the Chinese Room argument describes is the Central Processing Unit (CPU). The primary function of computers is to interpret and manipulate symbols; and in order to process information in the correct order, a precise timing mechanism is required. This acts as a synchronisation and sequencing device that ensures information is processed in the right order.</p> <p>The process of parsing characters from binary information held in a computer\u2019s memory to symbols occurs every time a character is displayed on a computer screen. In essence, it is the most basic process a computer can do. At the simplest level, a sentence stored in computer memory is a string of binary bits \u2013 in the case of magnetic hard drive, these are magnetically charged particles that are either in an on or off state (represented as a <code>1</code> or a <code>0</code>).<sup>36</sup> In the case of the 1972 American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII), a common text-storage system, seven bits are used to represent any one of 128 characters, encompassing capital and lowercase letters, numbers, punctuation symbols and computer teletype instructions (see Figure 2-20). For example, the uppercase letter H is represented by <code>0001001</code>. A sentence could be represented by simply stringing multiple strings together (so Hello would be <code>0001001 1010011 0011011 0011011 1111011</code> \u2013 spaces added for clarification). I decided that parsing information, character by character, would be an appropriate thing for the performance to diagram. I also decided that it would be interesting to employ a bank of human computers to parse information through dance, standing in the V&amp;A Museum. This would fit with the principles that I sought to investigate through the DwH programme, as well as display a computational principle for the Digital Design Weekend.</p> <p>I then needed a means of making the performance as visible as possible \u2013 and changing the way that people moved around the space. The mode of operation would have to employ some sort of binary state in order to unambiguously reflect digital storage, conveying information in a highly visible way, but still require the audience to decode it. Like a CPU, whose internal clock is invisible to a computer user, the internal instructions fed to each dancer would be hidden from the public, yet synchronise the actions of the dancers. I decided to use four dancers because that would simultaneously allow for a multitude of characters to be conveyed via a lookup table, and provide a means of making the performance large, and visible to the public.</p> <p>I commissioned costume designer Magdalena Gustafson to work on costumes that would extend the physical reach of the designers. Being interested in the binary nature of the movements the dancers would be able to move to, we devised a system whereby each dancer would wear two large \u2018sails\u2019, around 3.4m high, which would attach to their back via a pair of masts affixed to a backpack (the backpacks themselves were constructed from modified baby transporters; the poles were modified lightweight fishing rods). The \u2018boom\u2019 of each sail would be held in the dancers\u2019 hand, and extend their reach by approximately 2.2m in each direction. This would allow the dancers to use a semaphore-like mode of signalling to move into one of four positions: both sails down; both sails up; left-hand sail down/right-hand sail up; right-hand sail down/left-hand sail up; and both sails down. These positions were called 0-3 (in computing, zero is usually the first number that is used for counting).</p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch2/#nybble-dance-instructions-sheet-21-september-2013","title":"Nybble dance instructions sheet: 21 September 2013","text":"Move No. Dancer A Dancer B Dancer C Dancer D Symbol represented ASCII Table equivalent Symbol Direction Position Direction Position Direction Position Direction Position 0 0 BACK 0 FRONT 0 BACK 0 BACK 0 4 <code>D</code> 1 3 BACK 3 BACK 3 BACK 3 FRONT D 1 <code>a</code> 2 3 FRONT 3 FRONT 3 FRONT 3 BACK D 14 <code>n</code> 3 3 BACK 3 BACK 3 FRONT 3 FRONT D 3 <code>c</code> 4 3 BACK 3 FRONT 3 BACK 3 FRONT D 5 <code>e</code> 5 1 FRONT 1 FRONT 1 FRONT 1 FRONT B 15 <code>_</code> 6 3 BACK 3 FRONT 3 FRONT 3 BACK D 6 <code>f</code> 7 3 FRONT 3 BACK 3 BACK 3 FRONT D 9 <code>i</code> 8 2 BACK 2 BACK 2 FRONT 2 BACK C 2 <code>r</code> 9 2 BACK 2 BACK 2 FRONT 2 FRONT C 3 <code>s</code> 10 2 BACK 2 FRONT 2 BACK 2 BACK C 4 <code>t</code> 11 2 FRONT 2 FRONT 2 FRONT 2 FRONT C 15 <code>.</code> 12 1 FRONT 1 FRONT 1 FRONT 1 FRONT B 15 <code>_</code> 13 1 BACK 1 FRONT 1 BACK 1 BACK B 4 <code>T</code> 14 3 FRONT 3 BACK 3 BACK 3 BACK D 8 <code>h</code> 15 3 FRONT 3 BACK 3 BACK 3 FRONT D 9 <code>i</code> 16 3 FRONT 3 FRONT 3 FRONT 3 BACK D 14 <code>n</code> 17 3 FRONT 3 BACK 3 FRONT 3 FRONT D 11 <code>k</code> 18 2 FRONT 2 FRONT 2 FRONT 2 FRONT B 15 <code>_</code> 19 2 FRONT 2 FRONT 2 BACK 2 BACK D 12 <code>l</code> 20 3 BACK 3 BACK 3 BACK 3 FRONT D 1 <code>a</code> 21 2 BACK 2 FRONT 2 BACK 2 BACK C 4 <code>t</code> 22 3 BACK 3 FRONT 3 BACK 3 FRONT D 5 <code>e</code> 23 2 BACK 2 BACK 2 FRONT 2 BACK C 2 <code>r</code> 24 2 FRONT 2 FRONT 2 FRONT 2 FRONT C 15 <code>.</code> 25 1 FRONT 1 FRONT 1 FRONT 1 FRONT B 15 <code>_</code> 26 0 FRONT 0 BACK 0 BACK 0 FRONT A 9 <code>I</code> 27 2 BACK 2 FRONT 2 BACK 2 BACK C 4 <code>t</code> 28 3 BACK 3 BACK 3 BACK 3 BACK D 0 <code>'</code> 29 2 BACK 2 BACK 2 FRONT 2 FRONT C 3 <code>s</code> 30 1 FRONT 1 FRONT 1 FRONT 1 FRONT B 15 <code>_</code> 31 2 BACK 2 FRONT 2 BACK 2 BACK C 4 <code>t</code> 32 3 FRONT 3 BACK 3 BACK 3 BACK D 8 <code>h</code> 33 3 BACK 3 FRONT 3 BACK 3 FRONT D 5 <code>e</code> 34 1 FRONT 1 FRONT 1 FRONT 1 FRONT B 15 <code>_</code> 35 3 FRONT 3 FRONT 3 FRONT 3 BACK D 14 <code>n</code> 36 3 BACK 3 BACK 3 BACK 3 FRONT D 1 <code>a</code> 37 2 BACK 2 FRONT 2 BACK 2 BACK C 4 <code>t</code> 38 2 BACK 2 FRONT 2 BACK 2 FRONT C 5 <code>u</code> 39 2 BACK 2 BACK 2 FRONT 2 BACK C 2 <code>r</code> 40 3 BACK 3 BACK 3 BACK 3 FRONT D 1 <code>a</code> 41 3 FRONT 3 FRONT 3 BACK 3 BACK D 12 <code>l</code> 42 1 FRONT 1 FRONT 1 FRONT 1 FRONT B 15 <code>_</code> 43 3 FRONT 3 FRONT 3 FRONT 3 FRONT D 15 <code>o</code> 44 2 BACK 2 BACK 2 FRONT 2 BACK C 2 <code>r</code> 45 3 BACK 3 FRONT 3 BACK 3 BACK D 4 <code>d</code> 46 3 BACK 3 FRONT 3 BACK 3 FRONT D 5 <code>e</code> 47 2 BACK 2 BACK 2 FRONT 2 BACK C 2 <code>r</code> 48 2 FRONT 2 FRONT 2 FRONT 2 FRONT C 15 <code>.</code>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch2/#nybble-cheat-sheet-21-september-2013","title":"Nybble cheat sheet: 21 September 2013","text":"Row Direction A Direction B Direction C Direction D Position 0 Position 1 Position 2 Position 3 0 BACK BACK BACK BACK <code>@</code> <code>P</code> ` <code>p</code> 1 BACK BACK BACK FRONT <code>A</code> <code>Q</code> <code>a</code> <code>q</code> 2 BACK BACK FRONT BACK <code>B</code> <code>R</code> <code>b</code> <code>r</code> 3 BACK BACK FRONT FRONT <code>C</code> <code>S</code> <code>c</code> <code>s</code> 4 BACK FRONT BACK BACK <code>D</code> <code>T</code> <code>d</code> <code>t</code> 6 BACK FRONT FRONT BACK <code>F</code> <code>V</code> <code>f</code> <code>v</code> 7 BACK FRONT FRONT FRONT <code>G</code> <code>W</code> <code>g</code> <code>w</code> 8 FRONT BACK BACK BACK <code>H</code> <code>X</code> <code>h</code> <code>x</code> 9 FRONT BACK BACK FRONT <code>I</code> <code>Y</code> <code>i</code> <code>y</code> 10 FRONT BACK FRONT BACK <code>J</code> <code>Z</code> <code>j</code> <code>z</code> 11 FRONT BACK FRONT FRONT <code>K</code> <code>[</code> <code>k</code> <code>{</code> 12 FRONT FRONT BACK BACK <code>L</code> <code>\\</code> <code>l</code> <code></code> 13 FRONT FRONT BACK FRONT <code>M</code> <code>]</code> <code>m</code> <code>}</code> 14 FRONT FRONT FRONT BACK <code>N</code> <code>^</code> <code>n</code> <code>~</code> 15 FRONT FRONT FRONT FRONT <code>O</code> <code>_</code> <code>o</code> <code>.</code> <p>Dancers\u2019 individual direction represents row) All dancers in position (represents column)</p> Figure 2-12: Dance instruction sheet, and \u2018code cheat sheet\u2019 from Saturday 21<sup>st</sup> September 2013.

Internal spaces within the institution are highly regulates spaces due to the number of valuable artefacts. We decided to place the dancers in the John Madjeski Garden: it had high visibility, and an almost stage-like setup around a pond, and the people there tended to be taking a \u2018break\u2019 from the main exhibition spaces to eat and drink (in short, a captive audience). The costume designer and I decided to use bold, electric blue and light green colours for the sails, both to compliment the iconic Dale Chihuly chandelier in the V&amp;A\u2019s main entrance (the first thing most people see on entering the museum), and to stand out against the vivid orange of the bricks within the courtyard. The sails would have a clear directionality; if the dancer was facing towards the audience, they would only see blue, whereas rear-facing dancers would reveal a flash of bright green, aiding the interpretation of the code the dancers would be parsing.</p> <p>The development of the code was an area that required solving fairly early on in the process. Abi, who would be the controller, and I discussed multiple possibilities, but our priority was the ease and accuracy of conveying a message to each of the dancers on the day, telling them what to do. We decided to use a walkie-talkie system to communicate with the dancers; this would enable the transmission of instructions without the public\u2019s knowledge. We decided on a message to parse: a popular misquote from Samuel Beckett\u2019s Waiting for Godot which accurately encapsulated what the dancers would actually be doing:</p> <p>Dance first. Think later. It\u2019s the natural order.<sup>37</sup></p> <p>The use of a misquote was a conscious decision; the message was sufficiently meaningless, and devoid of context, that the entire dance could be rendered absurd<sub>a</sub> and absurd<sub>b</sub>. In order to ensure that the dancers accurately represented Searle\u2019s argument, none were told the message until after all of the performances were over.</p> <p>The next decision was about the code-table that the dancers would be effectively parsing. Four dancers moving to four different positions, and each facing one of two directions simultaneously could represent 512 potential symbols in an ASCII-style table. This was far too much detail\u00a0\u2013 if the overall dance were to portray a message in English, it would require only capital or lowercase letters (52), plus a small array of punctuation symbols. In order that the audience stood some chance of being able to interpret the dance, I reduced the potential symbols the dancers could represent to 64. The dancers would all move simultaneously to one of the four listed positions above (representing the column in Figure 2-19) and the direction that the dancers faced would indicate the row. With this table configuration, the word Hello would consist of five moves. This was, technically, a sub-optimal mode of information storage \u2013\u00a0I could have used a lookup table which utilised each of the dancers\u2019 four positions in two directions separately, giving 4096 symbols, but had no real need for this level of complexity. It also aided the process of telling the dancers what to do: they were universally told to move to the same \u2018position\u2019, but the direction they faced was an individual instruction.</p> <p>In order to enable the creation of a set of instructions for the controller to read, which would contain all 196 dancer positions to convey the 49 characters in the message, along with the dancers\u2019 names, I built a simple programme in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet that would provide detailed instructions, character-by-character, for each of the dancers. The task may have been easier to carry out in a lower-level programming language, using a simple three-dimensional array, but I enjoyed the absurd<sub>a</sub> nature of using a spreadsheet to determine an artistic performance. I believe that the spreadsheet is a largely unseen influential force in artistic and architectural practice; much of the work of producing a performance such as Nybble is balanced through the spreadsheets which carry the financial budgets and task and time allocation. The impact of the Excel spreadsheet is perhaps one of the most mundane, yet influential, means by which numerous decisions are really made within both art and design. I also took pleasure in using mundane, office-related software to drive an artwork in a festival which is supposed to celebrate the radical newness of digital design.</p> <p>The dance sequencing itself was devised partly through dance workshops (which will be discussed later), but mostly through the assessment of how CPUs handle information stored in memory. When retrieving information from Random Access Memory (RAM), 50% of the memory is used as address; that is, merely to locate the information the computer is to process, whilst the other 50% is used to store the information itself. This implied that around half of the time spent processing information is spent locating it, or preparing to process. The dance we would carry out would follow a similar formula; the dancers would spend half of their time receiving instructions, and half of the time \u2018processing\u2019 them. Of course, this would happen at an order of magnitude slower than a digital computer; parsing the 49 characters of the message we conveyed would take approximately 25 minutes. Each symbol being represented would be one move; a position for all of the dancers to collectively move to, and a direction for each one to face individually. The instructions, and synchronisation cues, would be delivered by the controller (played by Abi) who would speak into a walkie-talkie over the top of a synchronisation soundtrack.</p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch2/#soundtrack","title":"Soundtrack","text":"<p>As a CPU is dependent on its internal clock for synchronisation, the dancers in Nybble would use a hidden timing mechanism to stay synchronised. This would enable the bank of dancers, who would be positioned several metres apart, to receive instructions and coordinate their moves to match each other. The dancers would each wear a walkie-talkie radio with an earpiece, tuned to the same frequency. At the other end, the controller would transmit a timing signal and instructions to the dancers. This meant that the signals of the soundtrack would have to be easily intelligible via a low-resolution radio bandwidth. In addition, I wanted the soundtrack to have the audio aesthetic of the 1940-50s Britain which Alan Turing had inhabited, and echoes of the Shipping Forecast. This last influence was of particular importance as I have been an avid listener of the late night Shipping Forecast on BBC Radio 4 for years, enjoying its soothing and rhythmic mode of delivering semi-coded information, yet never really known what the numbers meant \u2013\u00a0a similar state to how I imagined the audience would receive this work.</p> <p>The audio track would have to be distinctive, carrying both spoken and audio cues, so that if a radio ceased functioning, or the whole message did not transmit, the dancers could still quickly assess where they were in the sequence. Every second, a computer-generated austere male voice would announce a count, between two and eight, with the \u2018one\u2019 count being replaced by the instruction to \u2018hold\u2019 or \u2018go\u2019 \u2013\u00a0that is, the dancers should adopt their pause positions or move. Between count, a sine wave beep (much like the \u2018pips\u2019 on BBC Radio 4) would play to establish continuity, and at the final count of the bar, a double-count would play:</p> <pre><code>Hold beep 2 beep 3 beep 4 beep 5 beep 6 beep 7 beep 8 beep, beep\nGo!  beep 2 beep 3 beep 4 beep 5 beep 6 beep 7 beep 8 beep, beep\n</code></pre> <p>In the time when dancers were transitioning between positions, they would be given an instruction as to how to move (e.g. \u2018fire\u2019, \u2018underwater\u2019). These instructions were the result of three workshops in which Abi worked with the dancers and established the particularities of giving live instructions for them to work with. The dancers needed something to focus on whilst moving into position, and the variation that this improvisation provided in also served to provide visual interest for the audience. The synchronisation track and instructions were delivered via walkie-talkie; the synchronisation track, which was looped, was played on repeat through an iPod, the earpiece of which was taped to the microphone of the controller\u2019s headset. This meant that the controller could speak over the soundtrack, and the low-resolution radios (designed for use in loud environments such as nightclubs) would transmit the loudest noise. Each dancer wore a walkie-talkie, clipped to their rucksack, and a one-way earpiece.</p> <p>The installation\u2019s name was chosen close to the work\u2019s performance, and was the result of a conversation with artist and (at the time) co-tutor in the Interactive Architecture Lab, Ruairi Glynn. The name emerged through thinking about the quantity of information each dancer would convey; their four potential positions would be analogous to half a byte (eight \u2018bits\u2019) of information. Within computing, half a byte is known as a nybble (word-play on the similarity of byte to bite). The concision of the word, along with its implicit humility, summarised the ethos of the performance.</p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch2/#dancers","title":"Dancers","text":"<p>This project represents the first time I had worked with dancers, and my expertise in this field was minimal. My friend Andrea Mongenie, who had been a casting agent for the London Olympics opening ceremony, offered a wealth of advice. In order to attract attention to the project, I created a trailer film from promotional footage of IBM computational systems, taken from the Prelinger Archives.<sup>38</sup> The teaser was designed to illicit interest from potential dancers. It combined the following dialogue with images of a computer parsing text:</p> <p>The computer is then given the problem in the form of numbers or instructions pertinent to arithmetic.

The six artists who were resident would each team up with a choreographer and dancers from the Opera in order to create a performance or intervention in the publically-accessible areas of the Opera Garnier building for two evenings. We began working on this project as soon as we joined the Pavillon programme. I had known about this collaboration when I had been offered the position at the Palais de Tokyo some months earlier, so had begun to work on technical aspects of the project in advance.</p> Figure 2-22:  Scriptych performance at Opera Garnier in June 2016. Photo by Justine Emard. <p>In the intervening time between Nybble and Scriptych, advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning had been widely publicised through media, and truly entered the public discourse. One of the major advances that had come to my awareness was the use of high-dimensional vector spaces to transform complex problems, such as translating languages and recognising the content of images, into spatial problems \u2013 albeit spaces consisting of potentially hundreds of vectors. This means that, much as Searle argued over thirty years before, computers were able to solve problems with the appearance of understanding their context and meaning, when really they were working through mathematical means. The application of machine learning to solve problems that we might categorise as about meaning (e.g. image-recognition, linguistic analysis) has been explored extensively by teams at Google.<sup>41</sup></p> <p>With words, for example, the Word2vec algorithm (developed by Tomas Mikolov et al at Google) requires a huge dataset of words (the training dataset used is often the first 5 billion words from Wikipedia), which are then parsed into sentence form.<sup>42</sup> The algorithm tokenises all words, and sequentially calculates the word in question\u2019s frequency, and its average distance from all other words. From this it can create a unique multi-dimensional vector for that word, consisting of several hundred dimensions. Through these complex word-vectors, implicit relationships between words emerge, allowing for a form of word-algebra to take place. The famous example that is regularly used to explain Word2vec is that the words for:</p> <p><code>(king \u2013 man) + woman = queen</code></p> <p>Similarly, the relationship between Athens and Greece is similar to Oslo and Norway, whilst common adjective-to-adverb relationships (e.g. apparent and apparently, rapid and rapidly) can be explained mathematically.<sup>43</sup> These word-relationships are common across languages, so that the vector for a word in English is likely to be similar to its equivalent in Spanish. As the MIT Technology Review reported in December 2014, a similar technique was tested with images.<sup>44</sup></p> <p>The reduction of language to a series of mathematical vectors which would only be legible to computers reminded me of the frequent communication breakdowns in plays of the Theatre of the Absurd. As with Searle\u2019s Chinese Room argument in Nybble, I wanted to carry out a new project to explore ideas surrounding this type of machine learning. I also wanted to carry out a performance in a way that experimented with a different approach to Nybble, developing a project that would contain scripting and rapid, iterative design as an integral part of the process in order to explore different modes of producing dance performances. However, I wished to retain the use of explicit constraints placed on performers.</p> <p>In November 2015, the six artists in the Pavillon residency began having meetings with the Paris Opera in which artists would be paired with choreographers in order to produce an evening of performance in the Opera Garnier. From early on in the process, I knew that vector space would be intrinsic to the methodology of producing this work. In the period preceding the Opera project, I had spent two months in Chicago (where my partner had started a new job) before moving to Paris. Both of these transitions had made me question my own ability to communicate; I had become intrigued by the syntactic differences between British English and American English, which meant that I often struggled to, for example, order coffee \u2013\u00a0and in Paris, my grasp of French was pitiful. My own inability to communicate effectively became fuel and inspiration for Scriptych.</p> <p>The first meeting with Opera was on the 19<sup>th</sup> of November. During this round-table discussion, I had expressed my desire to work with vector-space, and integrate some means of converting dancers\u2019 movements into vectors, and consequently into words. Numerous dances contain \u2018spatial conversations,\u2019 whereby the movements of two or more dancers react to each other (or an audience), but this project would aim to take this idea a stage further: technologically mediated spatial conversations. The initial idea was primitive, and based solely around this principle; it was only when the true conversation and collaboration started between myself and the choreographer Simon Valastro that the performance evolved rapidly. This project was developed concurrently with other projects contained in this thesis \u2013\u00a0Network / Intersect and 24fps Psycho, and its working title, until approximately one month before the performance took place, was, rather unoriginally, Vector Space Translation.</p> Figure 2-23:  Scriptych performance at Opera Garnier in June 2016. Photos by Justine Emard. <p>The group of artists visited the site of the performance, Opera de Garnier, both as building visitors, and to see several shows which featured the dancers and choreographers we would be working with. The building is much-discussed in architectural literature, and on one particularly memorable occasion we were taken on a long tour of the myriad hidden spaces which enable the building to operate: pulleys and levers under the stage, rehearsal studios, tunnels, and so on. The building appeared to be a large machine inhabited by its dedicated staff. I was particularly taken by the grand staircase which is encountered immediately after entering the building from the main entrance: Forty writes of the building\u2019s architect Charles Garnier\u2019s belief that the stair \u2018is one of the most important arrangements (dispositions) in theatres because it is indispensable to the ease of arranging the exits (d\u00e9gagements) and the circulation, but more because it produces an artistic motif.\u2019<sup>45</sup> Upon entering the theatre, I was struck by the staircase\u2019s inherent theatricality; visitors were transformed into performers, elevated for all to see. The same was true of the balconies surrounding the staircase: spaces of high visibility, and also granting vistas to visitors. Opera Garnier is a building for socialising as much as seeing performances, and the staircase signals the beginning of a journey into theatricality. The building seemed to epitomise Gage\u2019s statement that \u2018Architecture is differentiated from building in that it is deemed to induce sensations of delight or wonder in its observers.\u2019<sup>46</sup></p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch2/#design-process","title":"Design process","text":"<p>My initial idea for the project revolved around translating dancers\u2019 movement into vector-spatial data, converting this to words, and displaying some sort of \u2018conversation\u2019 between a pair of dancers. In order to prove this concept, I had to develop two things \u2013\u00a0an interface to interpret movement, and data to be interpreted. Over the period of January \u2013 March 2016, I experimented with Gensim, a Python-based framework for modelling with large datasets (which included Word2vec functions).<sup>47</sup> Over this period, I acquired multiple large-scale datasets (approximately 45Gb) and trained models with the intention of learning fundamentals of the principles to see the differing effects of various datasets and vector sizes, using online tutorials and guides.<sup>48</sup> My initial experiments yielded results that were of some use: it appeared that an optimum number of vectors was 300 per word, and \u2018cleaner\u2019 datasets yielded less erroneous results. However, each word library that I was creating was around 300,000-600,000 words, with words reflective of the miscellaneous sources: although the libraries contained many recognisable words and word-derivatives, they also contained highly technical words (e.g. <code>obgyn</code>, <code>vioxx</code>, <code>bextra</code>), online abbreviations (e.g. <code>wts</code>, <code>fccjobs</code>, <code>niccr</code>), mis-spelled or conjoined words (e.g. <code>constructech</code>, <code>advertisementbut</code>, <code>supportfootnotes</code>) and some which were meaningless and bizarre (e.g. <code>shinnecocks</code>, <code>athanassios</code>, <code>imclone</code>, <code>limbaughricans</code>, <code>ogio</code>).</p> <p>The Gensim Word2vec Python library that I was using enabled several querying mechanisms: words could be directly queried (e.g. searching for the word <code>king</code> and returning its vector), or closest-match vectors could be calculated (e.g. searching for a particular vector and returning the closest word in the array of words in the \u2018dictionary\u2019). The latter is the technique used for the word-algebra described above: in the <code>king \u2013 man + woman = ?</code> example, the word <code>queen</code> is returned as a result of a search for the nearest vector once the mathematical calculation for <code>king \u2013 man + woman</code> has been done. This method would be the one I\u2019d use for the Scriptych word-retrieval mechanism: the dancers\u2019 movements would be converted into vectors, then the nearest word would be returned from the library. However, I would have to make significant changes to improve the quality, and reduce the quantity of words available in order to be able to retrieve any from human movements with a degree of accuracy. Doing this would entail devising a new way to conceptualist movement in space.</p> <p>One of the technical problems to solve was precisely how the dancers\u2019 moves would be translated into vectors. This was something developed through conversation with the choreographer and dancers, and a period of iterative design and testing in the Opera. After a few meetings, I was paired with the choreographer Simon Valastro.<sup>49</sup> Whilst approaching the project from two different angles, and with different levels of knowledge about each other\u2019s disciplines, we shared common principles about the rules of the project: we both wanted to work on a project that would push both of us out of our comfort zones, with a high risk of failure; the performance would contain a narrative structure that could be interpreted by an audience, rather than simply being abstract dance; and we were both keen that the technology involved would have to really work, in real-time in front of an audience.</p> <p>My initial design for the word-retrieval system was laughably absurd<sub>a</sub>. It used the gyroscope data of an X-OSC board (a small wireless interface board with gyroscope and accelerometer built-in, which functioned much like the popular Arduino Uno) and took 100 triple-axis measurements at intervals of 100ms to generate a 300-dimension vector, which could then be used to retrieve a word. This meant that the dancers would have to be consistent in their movements, in each of three movement axes, thirty times in a row over three seconds (I conceived of this method since the introductory word-vector examples all encode words in 300 vectors). However, this level of precision is far greater than even the best industrial robot may be able to produce. It was comically bad. I began to meet Simon regularly morning to make the mechanisms responsive to the way he actually moved.</p> <p>Each day, I would visit Simon\u2019s studio in the Opera in the morning before his rehearsals so we could play with the latest version of the software. We would test the interface, and try to develop movements which would work. Then, after lunch, whilst he had to rehearse for the ballet he was working on (William Forsythe\u2019s Creation), I would work on improving the code in line with new ideas from the day\u2019s rehearsal. Our lunches proved fertile spaces for conversation about theoretical changes that could be made, which I would build though the afternoon and evening. This proved to be an extremely productive way of developing the interface, and the end result was a highly useable word-retrieval system that could be easily customised to suit the physiology of each user.</p> <p>The two main barriers to achieving a usable interface point were the reduction of the size of the word library that Gensim/Word2vec created, and the number of vectors each word contained. Simon and I discussed the cinematic nature of the choreography we wanted to develop: the balconies of our site, seen from the opposite side of the Grand Hall, were at a 16:9 ratio, the same as a film screen. Our audience would be international, and therefore, any project presenting spoken words would have to use a vocabulary that could be easily understood. We decided to generate a new library of words taken exclusively from Hollywood film dialogue, using the Cornel Movie Dialogues Corpus.<sup>50</sup> This resulted in a new library of 17,067 words, many more of which were far more intelligible than those generated earlier.<sup>51</sup> In addition, we realised that since our purposes for using the vector-space were different to most computer scientists \u2013\u00a0we would not be doing any complex word arithmetic or calculations \u2013 we would be able to encode the words in only three dimensions, instead of three hundred. This meant that we now had a three-dimensional database of words, a concept that is far easier to comprehend since both Simon and I were used to dealing in the three dimensions of the physical world.</p> <p>The next challenge was to create a mode of locating words within this three-dimensional space. The simplest solution would have been to simply make the dancers move to access a physical position and touch a particular position, for example, with their fingertips, and perhaps use a depth-tracking sensor such as a Microsoft Kinect to measure the dancers. But there are limitations to this mode of movement, and we opted not to use this technique for several reasons. Firstly, the field of range for such sensors is not very large, and therefore the dancers would likely be restricted to a virtual \u2018cube\u2019 around their bodies. Secondly, this mode of interaction is a lot like the now tired touch-screen interfaces which have populated sci-fi films such as Minority Report for at least the past fifteen years. A dance using an interface like this would simply be a rehashing of old ideas. And thirdly, the hardware required to make this happen would have to be fixed in place, in some way interfering with and \u2018technologizing\u2019 the Opera Garnier.</p> Figure 2-24:  Scriptych performance in progress at Opera Garnier, as seen from the \u2018control booth\u2019. Photo by Justine Emard. <p>As such, we worked with a different measurement of movement: the accelerometers and gyroscopes from a pair of iPhones. On one of our earliest meetings, Simon and I had switched to using iPhones instead of the X-OSC board. This had initially been a matter of convenience\u00a0\u2013 the X-OSC had required a fiddly and unreliable setup process each time we met, which wasted a lot of our time. But both of us always had our iPhones to hand, which contained a multitude of sensors and wireless capacity which we would be able to use at any time. Using the app GyrOSC, we were able to take an iPhone\u2019s internal sensor data and convert this to streaming Open Sound Control (OSC) messages.<sup>52</sup> The messages could then be received and interpreted by an instance of Max software running on my laptop computer, ready to be interpreted and used to loop up words in the database. A further useful function of the GyrOSC software was the ability to remotely trigger a short vibration from the computer, providing a means of invisible haptic feedback to the dancers. There were a few technical issues which we managed to resolve: the sensors in the different models of iPhone we had were calibrated differently, so the same movement gave different results or was prone to \u2018slippage\u2019 (which we resolved by replacing one of the phones for a newer, more accurate model). We also devised a means of affixing a phone to a dancers\u2019 body after much trial and error: phones would be inserted into a small neoprene pouch (made by the Opera\u2019s costume department) with a Velcro panel, the phones would be strapped to the underside of a dancers\u2019 wrist via a black elasticated sports bandage. We settled on this location as it offered a wide range of articulation to be measured, yet enabled the phone itself to be relatively hidden. The use of the neoprene pouches hid the phones themselves, thus preventing the work being read as an advert for a certain technology \u2013\u00a0or even appearing to be phones. Furthermore, the addition of the sports-bandages enabled the development of a ritualistic process of strapping for each dancer, which we would integrate into the first \u2018act\u2019 of the performance.</p> <p>For the vector-library interface, I developed a novel technique of converting the dancers\u2019 movements to words. Each dancer would have a phone strapped to their right wrist, which would continuously transmit their respective live gyroscope and accelerometer data across a Wi-Fi network to my laptop. This data, labelled <code>d1</code> or <code>d2</code> depending on the phone, would be picked up via Max software. Max would then map these numbers to a range of values. However, these values would only be recorded if Max was in a designated \u2018listen\u2019 mode.</p> <p>The <code>x/y/z</code> gyroscope information read by Max was converted to an integer from 0-3 (4 total values). This meant that any angle reached by the dancers\u2019 wrists could be transformed to a three-part array, such as <code>[0 0 0]</code> or <code>[3 1 2]</code>, and the thresholds for mapping the data were adjusted to suit each dancers\u2019 range of movements.<sup>53</sup> The accelerometer readings indicated the phones\u2019 current movement. If this fell below a threshold for a designated period of time \u2013 one musical \u2018count\u2019 \u2013 Max would add the current three-part gyroscope integer array to its current \u2018move\u2019 \u2013 signalled to the dancer via a brief vibration of the phone on their wrist. If the accelerometer recorded no movement for two \u2018counts\u2019 the move would finish (signalled to the dancers via two brief phone vibrations), and be converted to a Genism Word2vec query which could return a word.</p> <p>Each three-part array is called a move, and the string of moves is called a sequence. A move may be <code>[2 2 3]</code> or <code>[2 0 1]</code> and a sequence may be constructed of one move, such as <code>[3 1 0]</code> (<code>night</code>) or <code>[2 2 0], [0 2 3], [3 0 2]</code> (<code>computer</code>) or even <code>[2 2 1], [1 1 3], [0 1 3], [2 0 0], [0 0 1], [1 1 1], [1 0 2], [0 2 2], [2 3 1], [0 2 3], [2 2 3], [2 3 3]</code> (<code>sensible</code>). Most sequences in the final performance consisted of between 1 and 3 moves.</p> <p></p> WORD VECTOR MOVE around <code>[-0.83194745 2.54594374 -0.9201659 ]</code> <code>[ 1. 3. 1.]</code> bris <code>[-0.10030068 0.147881 -0.1577425 ]</code> <code>[ 1. 2. 1.]</code> die <code>[ 3.87849402 -1.2009213 1.25881267]</code> <code>[ 3. 1. 2.]</code> down <code>[-2.75925088 4.41695166 -0.60041034]</code> <code>[ 0. 3. 1.]</code> inventory <code>[ 0.24513638 0.24457133 -0.24679211]</code> <code>[ 2. 2. 1.]</code> lied <code>[ 1.12106276 1.20003092 1.18674994]</code> <code>[ 2. 2. 2.]</code> lot <code>[ 3.77520919 -1.45847201 -1.5530647 ]</code> <code>[ 3. 1. 1.]</code> night <code>[ 3.83613348 -1.4175818 -3.80468154]</code> <code>[ 3. 1. 0.]</code> Table 2-3:  Some one-position words from Scriptych. Figure 2-25:  Opera Garnier de Paris. Photograph by the author. <p>The transformation of these sequences to spatial navigation is one part of the technical innovation within this project, and the best of my knowledge, represents an original innovation. The technique is as follows: the 17,067 words are stored as three-dimensional vectors within a database. This database is virtually represented within a cube, with an uneven distribution of words generated by Gensim/Word2vec. Each word therefore can be represented as a fixed point within this cube, so that searching for <code>[0.96784878, 0.98643523, -0.0787757]</code> would return the word \u2018absurd\u2019. The job of the phone that the dancers wear on their wrist is to translate their movements into spatial navigation within the virtual cube, thus moving to the coordinates that best represent the desired word. The challenge was creating a reliable, replicable means by which the dancers\u2019 movements could be translated to this spatial navigation within the virtual cube, using only the rotational data from the iPhone\u2019s built-in gyroscopes (which can only record rotational angles along three axes). In other words, a phone\u2019s rotational data would have to translate to virtual spatial movements. The resolution of the gyroscopes was down-sampled so that each angle was represented by an integer from 0-3. The sequences that the dancers perform represent a mode of navigating this space, with each \u2018move\u2019 in a sequence representing zooming in to a more specific part of the cube. Each \u2018move\u2019 represents subdividing the current cube into a 4x4x4 array of smaller cubes. A move to <code>[0 0 0]</code> would select the near most bottom left sub-cube, whilst <code>[3 3 3]</code> would select the cube furthest top right. Multi-part sequences apply this technique recursively, so that each move within a sequence represents a smaller \u2018zoom\u2019 by an order of four. The final word results from a nearest-word search from the central most point of the final cube of the navigation. This navigation technique allows the user to move to a small set of positions (four positions in each axis) yet generate a 3d position with the degree of accuracy necessary for any necessary word in a relatively small number of moves.</p> Figure 2-26:  TouchOSC interface for a controlling system readiness and music during performances. Photograph by the author. <p>In order to be able to predict the words that dancers would be dancing with \u2013 and provide them with a written performance script to dance to \u2013 I wrote a Python programme to map the necessary navigation for each word. Most common words took 1-3 moves per sequence to reach, which was far easier than the initial hypersensitive prototype I had shown Simon previously. Both dancers would be \u2018speaking\u2019 words via their movements (see Figure 2-27). Given the irregular spacing of the words in the three-dimensional space (due to the clustered method of specialisation by the Word2vec functions), a few of the initial sub-cubes were \u2018empty\u2019. One of these was used as a \u2018flush\u2019 position, which would enable the dancers to clear the current array if they suspected they had hit the wrong position. Since most useful words can be reached within five moves the act of creating a word generally takes around 3-5 seconds.</p> <p>Here are some one-position move examples:</p> <p>I believe this method of navigation \u2013 translating three-axis arm rotation into three-dimensional, scaling movements through an array of increasingly small cubes in order to retrieve particular vectors \u2013 is novel.</p> <p>I created a dialogue for the performance, which would act as its script, using only words accessible within 3 move sequences. The dialogue was about the impossibility of conversation \u2013\u00a0in equal part inspired by the direct experience I had trying to maintain communications with my partner across time-zones with faltering digital connectivity, and by the central tenet of Gordon Pask\u2019s Conversation Theory, which I believe has roots that are in line with absurd<sub>b</sub> principles. Pask\u2019s 1976 book Conversation Theory discusses the mechanisms by which conversations take place. Since concepts are formed by minds based on experiences, and experiences are subjective, Pask argues, all communication between two sentient beings can hope to do is reach a mutually satisfying definition of the same concept.<sup>54</sup> This renders true and total communication impossible; although, much like a machine which can pass the Turing Test, there are ways to ensure that the other mind is understanding enough of what one is saying to get by. The dialogue I wrote was designed to appear as a conversation between two people separated from each other, but in reality both are more interested in their own viewpoints than listening to one another. The structure is palindromic: one dancer\u2019s lines are merely the others\u2019, reversed.</p> <p></p> DANCER A DANCER B a fragment - all that remains - a conversation hello? we talk hello? we listen can you hear me? we don\u2019t listen we don\u2019t listen can you hear me? we listen hello? we talk hello? a conversation - all that remains - a fragment Figure 2-27:  Scriptych performance script. <p>Several of the words required multi-position moves; in tests, these slowed the pace of the dialogue and made it hard for an audience to understand that the dancers were talking to each other; each extra position added another couple of seconds and slowed the pace, and intelligibility of dialogue between the dancers down. However, due to the uneven spatial distribution of words in the dictionary, many of the initial 64 \u2018positions\u2019 that the dancers could move to were \u2018open\u2019. In order to speed the word-retrieval up, we chose to create \u2018shortcut\u2019 moves within several of these positions, so that all of the words in the dialogue would be single-position movements. We also decided that the delivery of these words should be spoken as a sentence, so that dancers were assembling chunks of text, rather than individual words (which had a strange, floating, appearance in tests, and made following dialogue hard). This required building an anticipatory \u2018listen\u2019 function within Max that would assemble strings of words into sentences, something that would require the construction of a control-interface.</p> <p>Working over the period of around a month, Simon and I progressed from the development of a viable interface to the development of a viable performance. We decided to give the performance a three-part structure, so that the audience would firstly see two dancers on the opposite balconies moving with the distinctive visual grammar that Simon had developed to suit the interface. Two suited men would then enter the balconies, and wrap their arms with the straps whilst positioning the iPhones. This second phase would then show the dancers \u2018learning\u2019 to talk using their movements: generating simple words from movements, which would be played through speakers on their side of the Grand Hall. This would lead to their attempts at communication, working through the dialogue script I had written. Then, in the third phase, signalling frustration at their inability to effectively communicate, the performance would descend into a wall of unintelligible, manic and overlapping speech, accompanied by frantic and rapid choreography. This would be balanced by a slower reprise, where the first two lines of the dialogue (\u2018all that remains / a fragment\u2019) would be repeated by the female dancer. The three acts of highly scripted movements interacting with a computer, would be entitled Scriptych; a mistranslated play on the word triptych (meaning three associated works intended to be appreciated together). The misrepresentation of the concept of the triptych, in which the works are usually not connected, is a conscious reflection of the miscommunication caused by translation throughout the piece.</p> <p>The differing stages of the performance required the construction of a control interface, so that the \u2018listening\u2019 functions of the Max programme would be searching for the right number of words at the right times. There was a difference between the stage when the dancers were dancing without phones (which should produce no words), the stage where the dancers were creating one word at a time, the period of scripted dialogue, and the frenetic section. The data processing would all occur via a \u2018hub\u2019 of Max running on my computer. Max would constantly receive input with accelerometer and gyroscope readings from the dancers\u2019 two iPhones, as well as signalling input from an iPhone and iPad that Simon and I would operate to control the overall performance. These control interfaces would also use OSC to send and receive signals \u2013 in this case, running bespoke interfaces through the app TouchOSC.<sup>55</sup> From the iPad I could control the reading behaviour that Max would use to listen for the dancers\u2019 movements. I could also re-orient the gyroscopes on the dancers\u2019 arms, which would misalign after the period of intense freneticism in part 3 of the dance. We also divided the performance into eleven periods with different associated musical levels (which is described below). OSC was also used internally in the laptop to communicate between Max and Python \u2013 the use of one communication protocol for the entire performance simplified the workflow.<sup>56</sup></p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch2/#soundtrack_1","title":"Soundtrack","text":"<p>At the same time as the initial gyroscope readings, I started to build software to generate music for the performance. This was the second project I had developed using Max software, after 24fps Psycho (see chapter 3). The visual diagramming mode it uses to programme became intuitive over the months I was using it for, and it enabled multiple conversations to occur between Simon and myself about fairly abstract computing, using the visual language of the software (by the end of the process, Simon was able to correct some of my mistakes). The OSC protocol had been developed as a more advanced version of MIDI, allowing the lightweight transmission of streaming music data. It seemed only logical to use this same protocol to generate music.</p> <p>The initial music software was an arpeggiator \u2013 a piece of software which would play ascending and descending notes within a chord which would be generated from the OSC inputs. The aesthetic of this music was inspired by the recent Radiohead single Burn the Witch, and the orchestral work of Johnny Greenwood in the soundtrack to the film There Will Be Blood; I liked the tension created by the staccato string sections in both.<sup>57</sup> I also thought the D# minor scale used in Burn the Witch created a high level of suspense, which would be well-placed within this project. The arpeggiator would be based on a 4/4 timing. Initially, I built a primitive scale-finder which would identify all possible notes within a given scale. The three axes of the iPhone\u2019s gyroscope, <code>x/y/z</code>, would be used to select a bass, middle, and high note from four possible noted of each, based on thresholds within the incoming signal. If the phone\u2019s base rotation was 0-89\u00ba, it would play one note, 90-179\u00ba, the next note, and so on. The three axes generated three notes in a chord (low, middle and high). A numerical selector enabled the user to choose how many notes would play each bar: 0-4 (the fourth note would be the second note, repeated). The notes generated in Max would then trigger a staccato string sound in Ableton Live music generation software.</p> <p>The arpeggiator alone would not be enough to fill the entire entrance to Opera Garnier for nine minutes. Fortunately, the Pavillon was already working with the Institute National d\u2019Audiovisuel (INA), and for the evening of performance we would be using equipment and engineers from the GRM, INA\u2019s experimental music division. I was also able to work with Julien Perez, a former Pavillon resident and composer in the GRM\u2019s studios. By this time, Simon and I had already discussed at length the \u2018aesthetic\u2019 the soundtrack was to have. The GRM sound setup consisted of 8 highly controllable speakers throughout the room, and sophisticated software to enable sound to be highly spatialised. Julien and I created a drum beat which travelled from speaker to speaker with every hit; another, more intense, drum track; a \u2018heartbeat\u2019; two bass tracks; and a record-hiss style white noise track. These were all designed to work with the same timing structure, and the timing of the measurements of the phone movements, so that the dancers could measure their movements according to the ambient music. The music would be layered in a pre-choreographed order, so that the entire performance went through different emotional stages, from a slow, white noise-and-heartbeat-laden beginning, to a strings-accompanied arpeggiating (generated by one of the dancers\u2019 movements), slightly heavier middle section with the dialogue (generated by the dancers), to a period of intense movement, music and heavily overlaid speech (generated by the dancers). This penultimate stage was then followed by a moment of calm and silence, a pause by the dancers to gather their breath, and a slow return to fragmentary words of dialogue and a subtler iteration of the music from the second part.</p> <p>The creation of the soundtrack brought a range of technical issues to light. Firstly, through early tests of the arpeggiator in Simon\u2019s studio, we had found that the best way to build tension in the performance was to incrementally increase the number of notes the arpeggiator played, so that instead of progressing from nothing to a full 4-note arpeggiated chord, we would start playing only the first note of the bar, then the first two, and so on. We could then use a similar sound motif later in the performance to signal its closure. Since the processing of signals for the performance itself would take place on my computer, it made sense to also use it for part of the soundtrack \u2013\u00a0the voices, and synthesised, arpeggiated viola notes. However, on the evening of the performance, the GRM would install the 8-part speaker array into the Opera, which would offer the spatialised soundtrack. The interface for the speaker array was a large, specially built mixing desk with numerous inputs and outputs \u2013 but without a prolonged period for hardware and software testing, we had to compromise on the playback technique for the music. During the performance, the rest of the soundtrack would be played back as a \u2018sound bed\u2019: multiple channels of pre-recorded audio which could be faded in and out as appropriate. We developed a basic mode of synchronising playback so that all of the tracks would be in time with the generated music from my computer. The soundtrack would move between \u2018sections\u2019 through Julien\u2019s adjusting the playback levels (in reality this was done via pre-set level positions for each section, set on the desk).</p> <p>This live music generation caused a slight challenge: the other soundtracks that would play during the evening would all be exclusively pre-recorded or live. These pre-recorded tracks would be played through a dedicated computer with audio outputs into a large mixing desk, with adjustable output volumes. My soundtrack was different, mixing live audio input \u2013 which had to be in time\u00a0\u2013 with a spatialized pre-recorded soundtrack. Julien and I recorded a complementary 8-part soundtrack in the same time signature as the arpeggiator (120 bpm 4/4). This consisted of: a low, throbbing hum; a \u2018heartbeat\u2019 drum noise every 8 beats; a non-spatialised drum beat; a spatialised fast drum beat which circled the 8 speakers; and a spatialised bassline which would appear to move around the room. These sounds could be combined, along with the generated voices and arpeggiator, to create varying levels of tension and freneticism without changing the underlying time-signature. Before each performance, I would synchronise my computer\u2019s arpeggiator with the pre-recorded soundtrack on Julien\u2019s computer.</p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch2/#performance","title":"Performance","text":"<p>We worked with two dancers for a period of several weeks before the performance at the Opera. This enabled us to adjust the physical parameters of the readings to suit the dancers. The method that both dancers employed demonstrated to me some of the myriad ways in which dancers can interpret instruction, and how people understand technical systems. Simon had worked with the limited palette offered by the software and hardware we were using to create a choreography based around the short dialogue. The storyline was simple: a male and female dancer walked onto a balcony on the left and the right of the grand staircase in the Opera. They began, individually, to perform moves in a morose manner, unaware of each other\u2019s presence, as if they are practicing on their own. After a few minutes, they adopt a standing position; a suited man approaches each dancer and applies a device to their arm with a black strap. The music changes; the female dancer starts moving, whilst the male dancer remains still. Both dancers\u2019 movements begin to create individual fragmentary words (in reality this part was improvised each night, with dancers choosing their favourite positions). A subtle music cue causes the dancers to pause. The female dancer then performs a few lines of dialogue; the male dancer appears to respond, offering a greeting. Both of the dancers, although they appear to be talking to each other, are positioned parallel to each other, facing forwards towards the audience, rather than at each other. It becomes clear that they are not, in fact talking to each other, but rather repeating the same lines forwards and backwards. They become frustrated at their inability to communicate, and lash out, moving erratically and frantically, both spewing words at a frenetic rate. Finally, they stop, catch their breath, and attempt a conversation again. It is futile. They leave the stage to the lines:</p> <p><code>all that remains</code></p> <p><code>a fragment</code></p> Figure 2-28:  Dancers Eve Grinsztajn and Mathieu Contat practice Simon Valastro\u2019s choreography for Scriptych at Opera Garnier.

Both projects are linked thematically and formally, and were both shown at the same festival at the Palais de Tokyo. The first of the projects, 86400, used Google Images to create a film which displayed the most appropriate image for every second in a day, resulting in a 24 hour long looped film which could play in perpetuity.

The importance of these points to my own creative practice cannot be understated: having a place to work, resources to work with, and a date to aim for is the best method I have found for transforming the many kernels of ideas that propagate my computer and sketchbook into working, functional projects which can be exhibited and provoke conversation. This was certainly the case whilst at the Palais de Tokyo: I had access to two studios, one in my live-work space at the Cit\u00e9 internationale des Arts, and a dedicated large, shared studio for the Pavillon artists within the Palais de Tokyo itself, as well as the support of a dedicated production and curatorial team.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>Much like the atmosphere at the Bartlett, the environment is constantly changing in the Palais de Tokyo as exhibitions and events are assembled and disassembled asynchronously, and multiple events take place near-daily. Upon leaving the studio in the evening, having been immersed in work and isolated from the rest of the building, I could just as easily be confronted by a room full of tuxedoed executives sipping champagne at an awards gala as a haute couture catwalk show, or a crowd of revellers dancing to house music, or performance poetry.<sup>2</sup> One of the annual events that takes over the entire Palais de Tokyo is the Do Disturb festival, an eclectic celebration of dance, performance art, and design.<sup>3</sup> Both of the projects discussed in this chapter formed part of the Do Disturb programme in April 2016.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>In the build-up to the festival, I was working on four of the seven projects featured in this thesis (86400, 24fps Psycho, Scriptych and Network/Intersect), as well as travelling to multiple countries. Despite being predominantly based in Paris, I also spent two and a half months in Chicago, a month in Korea, and several weeks in Australia.<sup>5</sup> In order to stay in touch with family, friends, and colleagues during this time, it was necessary to remain constantly aware of the current hour in multiple time zones, as well as to jump from one mode of work (e.g. computational scripting) to another (e.g. live-action film direction) on a daily basis. This continuous switching of modes was largely facilitated through the use of computers and smartphones, which helped me keep track of shifting time zones, organise my schedule, keep in touch, collect and collate notes and ideas, and, in the case of the computer, carry out the work itself.</p> Figure 3-32:  Selection of images from 86400. By the author. <p>In the period since my doctoral research began, there have been significant changes in the way in which people use portable electronic devices. Ofcom\u2019s 2015 Communications Market Report, released with the by-line \u2018The UK is now a \u201csmartphone society\u201d\u2019, shows that 66% of the adult population own smartphones, and nearly half of those state that they are \u2018hooked\u2019 on their phones.<sup>6</sup> What\u2019s more, these devices have changed the way people behave. The report indicates that smartphones have pervaded even the most intimate areas of personal life: \u2018Half of young people aged 18-24 check their phones within five minutes of waking and two-fifths check it less than five minutes before going to sleep.\u2019<sup>7</sup> What\u2019s more, many local services previously handled via personal interaction, such as ordering food or hailing a taxi, can now be done remotely via apps such as Uber. The material ramifications of app-based technology and \u2018cloud computing\u2019 are real and widespread: Barcelona, for example, has imposed heavy fines on the hotel-alternative Airbnb due to its impact raising rent prices in the city;<sup>8</sup> the impact of taxi service Uber has been widely reported as acting aggressively in London and other cities worldwide;<sup>9</sup> the EU courts have enacted multiple rulings regarding the collection and retention of data on European citizens and cities by Google.<sup>10</sup> The impact of smartphone apps to facilitate, for example, navigation around a city, international communication, the ordering of food deliveries, or the scheduling of time, were especially apparent to me as I spent significant amounts of time in foreign countries. With the exception of South Korea (whose telecommunication industry is closely wedded to government, and have produced \u2018local\u2019 versions of apps such as Uber, WhatsApp, iMessage and Google Maps), I was able to use the same apps and services near-seamlessly in the UK, France, the USA, and Australia.<sup>11</sup> Google Maps and CityMapper enabled navigation of a city; Uber enabled me to hail taxis to and from anywhere (and also order food); WhatsApp, Gmail, iMessage, FaceTime and Skype more enabled me to communicate with family, friends and colleagues across the world.<sup>12</sup> Every social networking, messaging, or email service I used worked in the same manner as it had in London, provided I had a SIM card in my phone which enabled use of data networks. Had I been in the same position in the mid-2000s, or even the early 2010s, this would not have been the case; I remember spending hours in foreign cities searching for internet cafes in order to send messages home. In the early 2010s, I began noticing a general shift towards apps as services, and a reliance on \u2018cloud\u2019 computing, and unseen, remote databases, and in 2013-14, I began to investigate the most readily apparent of these computational companies: Google. I took particular interest in this company, as I have personally witnessed their growth and spread into many spheres of public life.</p> <p>I remember the first time I heard about Google, when its sole offering was a search engine, in 1998. Still a schoolboy, a friend had told me of the \u2018best\u2019 search engine, which selected its results by machine rather than the pre-approved directory method of the other major search engines of the day.<sup>13</sup> At the time, I thought the name was hilarious (although the humour threshold for my adolescent self was admittedly fairly low). Over time, I became a near-daily user of Google Search for homework, then Gmail, Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Blogger, Google Calendar, Google Reader, Google Maps, Google Scholar, Google Street View, Google Books, and numerous other Google services. From the time when I was in compulsory education to today, Google have grown exponentially, with an ever-expanding and diversifying offering of products and services.</p> <p>In 2009, I bought a Google Android phone. My experience of navigating London, to where I\u2019d recently moved, changed instantly \u2013\u00a0it became nearly impossible to get lost since a geolocated phone was in my pocket (unless, of course, the phone rang out of battery). I also had continuous access to email, news, calendars, documents \u2013 and the internet. My experience of London itself was largely shaped by the technology of the time. Much of this technology came from one San Francisco-based company. In 2013 I began to research Google as a corporation. My fascination stemmed from the fact that their products and services touched such a large part of so many peoples\u2019 lives on a daily basis, yet little is publicly known about the company itself.<sup>14</sup> I found that, on the whole, Google are quite un-Googleable; little information is publically available about staff or corporate structure. This leads to a one-way expectation of transparency, whereby Google provides numerous services in exchange for your personal information, yet never discloses its own corporate operations. Its own tax setup is notoriously complex and subject to criticism.<sup>15</sup></p> <p>I pored through the publically-available US tax returns from 2004 until 2013 (the year the company incorporated to the last date available at the time), and built a Google Sheets spreadsheet of declared assets, incorporations, and sales of subsidiary companies.<sup>16</sup> I made a Google Map of the addresses of company headquarters and directors\u2019 addresses as listed on the forms in an attempt to map the locations of the company.<sup>17</sup> It appeared that in 2011 the company had undergone a large corporate restructuring; they went from owning 28 companies in 2005, to 117 in 2010 (an acquisition rate of nearly one company per month) to owning just two companies in 2011: Google Ireland and Google Ireland Holdings. This structure is a perfect example of what the Irish Treasury call the \u2018Double Irish\u2019, a tax-avoidance measure which \u2018relies on arbitrage between the different tax rules used in different countries.\u2019<sup>18</sup></p> <p>Midway through this research, the company restructured again, part-splitting and becoming a subsidiary of the umbrella company Alphabet.<sup>19</sup> Although I was fascinated by several things within Google, my primary interest was their ability to continually expand their reach and scope, and the public perception of what the company was. From the origins as an algorithmically-driven search company, they had become a word ubiquitous with experimentation, a data-driven approach to computing myriad things. It came as no real surprise to me that Google were exploring self-driving cars, that they had piloted schemes to fly high-speed wireless access point balloons over developing nations to provide web access, that they were digitising thousands of books, installing high-speed internet in cities in the US, or participating in numerous other activities.<sup>20</sup></p> <p>I found their self-driving cars particularly interesting.<sup>21</sup> Whilst self-driving cars have been a serious subject of study since at least the 1930s, the computational technology to make them a mass-market reality has only recently emerged.<sup>22</sup> Keen to project an image of harmlessness and innocence, Google\u2019s (now Waymo\u2019s) self-driving cars have the appearance of enlarged childrens\u2019 toys.<sup>23</sup> Using LiDAR scanners, the cars build a highly accurate point-cloud map of the city they are in, as seen from the cars\u2019 perspective.<sup>24</sup> The cars also have access to a pre-existing 3d map of the area; the cars continually compare the scene they can \u2018see\u2019 at any one moment with the one that has already been created. Any difference is something that is to be recorded and used to make calculations.<sup>25</sup> This technique is interesting, as it relies on huge amounts of spatial data to interpret its environment, and the construction, optimisation and maintenance of huge databases. If the cars are implemented in the real world (as opposed to their current prototypical status), they may then also constitute an audacious mapping project: a millimetre-perfect three-dimensional map which is updated every time a car drives along a street.</p> <p>The Google self-driving car differencing technique reminded me of Gregory Bateson\u2019s influential lecture Form, Substance and Difference (later published as an essay).<sup>26</sup> In the talk, Bateson lays out a clear argument that: \u2018information \u2013 the elementary unit of information \u2013\u00a0is a difference which makes a difference [^original emphasis].\u2019<sup>27</sup> In the case of Google\u2019s self-driving cars, anything that is found in the latest LiDAR scan that is not in the existing model is a difference \u2013 Bateson called \u2018difference which occurs across time [...] \u201cchange\u201d.\u2019<sup>28</sup> For Bateson, the idea of difference is key to cognition. His argument is an extension of Alfred Korzybski\u2019s dictum the map is not the territory, (as discussed in this thesis\u2019 introduction).<sup>29</sup> The map that Google\u2019s self-driving cars use is effectively a diagram of differences, changes in a territory large enough to warrant a change in the cars\u2019 behaviour.</p> <p>Another company who announced its research into self-driving cars at around the same time was Uber, the controversial app-based ride-hailing company. Formed in June 2010, and utilising the inbuilt GPS and Wi-Fi geolocation technologies (both of which are synonymous with smartphones), Uber is a service which enables users of a smartphone-based app to order a taxi to their location at any time (usually within cities).<sup>30</sup> Taxi drivers and customers (referred to as \u2018riders\u2019) both use different interfaces within the same app to hail rides, and to find customers; the service is dependent on a large, dynamically-updating database which keeps track of all active riders and drivers at any one time.<sup>31</sup> In a similar manner to Google, Uber practises data asymmetry with its drivers and customers; drivers are never made aware of where their next customer wants to go until they have entered the vehicle, thus \u2018starting\u2019 the trip, whereupon they are provided with their end-destination and directions for their journey (all provided via the app screen);<sup>32</sup> the movements of all riders and drivers are also monitored at all times via a master interface the company variously called \u2018Heaven\u2019 or the \u2018God View\u2019.<sup>33</sup> Like many other app-based companies, the method for interaction that the apps offer is an Application Programme Interface (API), a standardised protocol by which information can be passed from a central server to a device, with most of the information processing taking place on a company\u2019s remote server.</p> <p>As with Google, I became interested in Uber in 2013 for several reasons. They are controversial in London and many other cities, where they undercut pre-existing transport companies and unions, and using a purely data-driven approach to transport logistics. Besides their labour practices, whereby drivers are technically self-employed (yet \u2018rides\u2019 are near-completely controlled by the company), they company also use interesting language to describe their operations. Their founder, Travis Kalanick, uses metaphors of fluidity similar to describe their ideal operation:</p> <p>Our philosophy is to always have an available ride to someone who wants it. Our mission, we like to say, is transportation as reliable as running water, everywhere for everyone.<sup>34</sup></p> <p>At the time of my moving to Paris, several articles had been published in mainstream press regarding Uber\u2019s next, \u2018audacious vision\u2019:<sup>35</sup> the perpetual trip.<sup>36</sup> This expands the fluid mode of movement that Uber envision for their drivers and passengers even further: all are subject to continuous movement, with drivers picking up and dropping off passengers travelling in similar directions on an ad-hoc basis, with the goal of near-continuous movement and multiple occupation of the car by passengers.<sup>37</sup> I became intrigued by the potential sensation of being an Uber driver on a perpetual trip \u2013\u00a0eternally moving, fed ad-hoc directions via a remote, human-less interface.<sup>38</sup> In his presentation discussing the company\u2019s operations in 2015, founder Travis Kalanick spent much time discussing the employment opportunities his company had created, as well as the ease with which riders could use the app, and the partnerships they were forging (and hoping to forge) with local governments, but very little time discussing the day-to-day experiences of being a driver.<sup>39</sup> The perpetual trip struck me as a strange new form of labour, a continually-updated journey to nowhere in particular, with a continually-changing series of passengers in the drivers\u2019 vehicle. I wanted to explore this concept metaphorically in a design project.</p> <p>In order to examine the world of these forms of emerging web-technology further (and their gradual transgression into the built environment), I decided to work in the media of the technologies themselves. I began learning Python, the language that which the original Google web-crawler was built in.<sup>40</sup> I also wanted to work with relational databases, which are the back-bone of many web services. I was also intrigued by the programming language Max, largely used by musicians and visual content creators, which offers a visual node-based mode of programming; I had seen it used by several media artists, and its diagrammatic mode of programming reminded me of the aesthetics of building electronic circuits or patches for synthesisers.<sup>41</sup> This investigation led to the creation of two projects. The first, 86400, looks at interfacing with Google via one of their APIs and attempting to represent a specific vision of how Google Images sees time visually. The second, 24fps Psycho, is a first-attempt at creating software that creates metaphors for the Uber perpetual trip. Both of these projects create films that are too long to actually watch.</p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch3/#86400","title":"86400","text":"<p>In 2010, Christian Marclay premiered a film called The Clock.<sup>42</sup> 24 hours in length, it consists entirely of excerpts from films and television programmes which features a depiction of the time on-screen, usually on a clock-face (but sometimes spoken). When exhibited, the film plays in real time, so that at any one moment the time on-screen is the real time. Being a 24-hour long montage, the audience are free to construct their own narratives and rationale connecting the films; it plays like a string-of-consciousness, the only consistent connection between the myriad segments being the representation of the time. The concept of the film resonated with me; the method of construction is similar to some of the Oulipo\u2019s poetic and storytelling methods.</p> <p>Google\u2019s Image Search, a service which enables users to search for images, was first released in 2001.<sup>43</sup> A web-crawler which enables users to search for images online, the early versions of the service created a large database of images found online, and categorised them according to the content of the web-page on which they were found (e.g. a caption below the image).<sup>44</sup> Google Image Search now allows for users to search by image\u00a0\u2013\u00a0instead of typing a search term in the search bar, users can drag an image from their computer. In 2011, the artist Sebastian Schmieg began experimenting with this function of the search engine, and created the first of an ongoing series of films whereby he conducts a recursive image search: uploading an image as a search, downloading the first returned image, using this as the next search \u2013 and so on. The first film in the series, Search by Image, recursively is a 12-frame-per-second video consisting of 2951 images, initiated through the upload of a transparent 400x225 pixel PNG-format image.<sup>45</sup> The film shows a series of seemingly-related images, working through images of galaxies, cities by night, screenshots of computer games, films, graphs, catalogue product photos, diagrams, and more. At one point a stylised \u2018meme\u2019 image is on-screen for several seconds, as multiple iterations with differing text and dimensions flash onscreen for a fraction of a second each. The film simultaneously shows the diversity and multiplicity of images found on the internet. It acts as a snapshot of a time, when the unseen inferences about images caused Google Images to equate any two images to each other (performing the same search at a later date may lead to a different series of images). In a similar way to Marclay\u2019s The Clock, I was impressed by the implicit relationship between disparate sources the audience was forced to question.</p> <p>On day in early 2015, whilst teaching myself to programme in the Python language in the Bartlett studio, I decided to search for the current time on Google Images, in the form of a 24-hour clock (e.g. 12:15:32). The result was a series of almost random images. I repeated the process for several more times, loosely following the clock as it changed in real-time (although unable to perform the search at the required speed of once per second!). The images that were returned occasionally bore a direct relationship to time, but very few featured, say, a clock, or a timestamp. I enjoyed trying to work out what the relationship between each one and the time really was. I decided to make a film which would feature the image for the current time, in the HH:MM:SS format, for all 86,400 seconds in the day \u2013\u00a0but instead of searching manually, I would automate a script to search for me.</p> <p>I wrote a basic Python script which would interact with the Google Images API, the programming interface that enables developers to interact with the Google Images service without the standard interface. The API was technically deprecated, meaning that it would be disabled within the near future, but was still functioning.<sup>46</sup> There are 86,400 seconds in any day\u00a0\u2013\u00a0which meant that I had a target of that number of images to return. The first task was the establishment of a data structure to hold the results of searches in a database which would make them useable at a later date.<sup>47</sup> I established a database with two tables: searches, and images, hosted on a remote server (which meant that I could enable multiple remote computers to work on the searching simultaneously). Each search would be logged as an item in the searches database, along with its success, the IP address the search was logged from, a timestamp, and a few more items of data. If a search was successful, the images it returned would be logged in the images table, along with information that the API provided, including their original context, various associated URLs, the IP address used for the search, an image description, and the image rights (ranging from public domain to copyrighted images). Each search would return up to four images, which were all logged in the images table. The first time a search term was used, it would be for public domain images; if this search was unsuccessful, it would search for two types of Creative Commons images, and finally for all images, including copyrighted images.<sup>48</sup></p> Figure 3-33:  Flowchart displaying operation for a single image search and interactions with the within the 86400 Python search programme. By the author. <p>I created a relational MySQL database with two tables, searches and images. The searches table would log all searches, successful and unsuccessful, whilst the images table would store all information on any images from the searches. The Google Images API allowed for searching with multiple criteria, including the rights-levels of returned images. I decided that it would be best if initial images were in the public domain; failing this, images that had various Creative Commons rights were better than potentially copyrighted images. Each time a search for a particular time returned no results, the next search for that time would be done at a less restrictive copyright level. Each second in the day corresponded to the number of seconds it was after 00:00:00 (so 00:00:00 was 0, 00:00:01 was 1, 00:01:00 was 60, 01:00:00 was 3600, and so on). Each loop of the programme operated as illustrated in Figure 3-33.</p> <p>I was limited to a certain number of images per hour, and appearing to come from each IP address. The programme would pause for a period if the API returned the error code associated with too many searches having been conducted. Each search also utilised a basic random IP address, so that the searches appeared to be coming from all over the globe. I ran the search programme overnight whilst working in London, Paris, and Chicago intermittently throughout 2015. It logged over 500,000 searches, and nearly 80,000 unique images in the first of its four best-image databases<sup>49</sup>. Towards the end of this image-scraping process, the Google Image Search API became increasingly unreliable, and eventually, it stopped working. Given the continual re-indexing of images, connections and assets that Google performs, and the inability to re-perform the same search again, the series of images that this programme recorded can be considered a snapshot of a specific aspect of Google\u2019s indexing of images, at a specific time in history.</p> <p>The final stage in the creation of the film was the assembling of the images into a film. I wrote a script which methodically downloaded all of the images in the first register (the number one search result) for every second whose image had been logged. In order not to get stuck on any one image, it downloaded multiple images simultaneously. Successful downloads were logged to the images table; after several unsuccessful attempts, an image would be marked as not available, and skipped later.<sup>50</sup> Once saved locally, another script copied images to another folder and resized them to ensure that they fitted within a 1920x1080 pixel frame, and thus would fit into a standard HD widescreen video size (images below that size were not changed). Finally, I generated all of the timestamps for images, from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59 as transparent PNG files in Processing. I then compiled the videos so that every image stayed on-screen for one second with the time displayed in a neutral sans-serif typeface over the top. The resulting film was 24 hours in length, and featured one image per second.</p> <p>The resulting film was shown in its entirety, in real-time, for three days at the Do Disturb festival at the Palais de Tokyo on the 9-11 April 2016. It was displayed on a screen of approximately 5 x 3m, at the apex of the Palais de Tokyo\u2019s main staircase \u2013 a location every visitor would pass. Unfortunately, during the festival, I was too busy working on the next project I will describe, 24fps Psycho, to gauge much audience reaction, or even watch the whole film (indeed, I have still not watched the film in its entirety). The continuous change, a barrage of images, and the natural audience tendency to try to interpret the reasoning behind each image\u2019s appearance, make viewing a strangely compelling, but also tiring experience. Once an image has passed, it is as if it is gone forever. The relentless one-image-per-second timing creates an ever-changing scene; it is a \u2018blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it\u2019 experience. Whilst knowing that the images onscreen bear only superficial relations to each other, the audience cannot help but search for links between them. This, in a way, reflects the essential premise upon which Camus\u2019 work is predicated (as summarised by Aronson), that \u2018human beings inevitably seek to understand life's purpose [^\u2026 but \u2026] the natural world and the human enterprise remain silent about any such purpose.\u2019<sup>51</sup></p> <p>In April 2017, I showed the work at the School of the Art Institute in Chicago. As well as the film itself, which again played in real time, I printed a series of posters which transformed the time onscreen into a regulated grid, so that each poster was equivalent to half an hour of time. The eight posters combined and displayed the hours of peak internet usage from 19:00:00 - 22:59:59 (also known as the internet \u2018rush hour\u2019).<sup>52</sup> I feel that the juxtaposition of the film, which portrays time as an overwhelming and relentless barrage of unpredictable images, and the posters, which present time as a \u2018thing\u2019 which can be rectilinearly ordered, abstracted and viewed from afar, created an interesting tension.</p> Figure 3-34:  Prints as displayed at School of the Art Institute Chicago.

The drivers\u2019 journey would likely take place in the town in which they lived; each journey would necessarily follow a logical spatial progression from one area to the next, yet the vehicle itself would be in a constant state of flux, as passengers were picked up and dropped off in any order. The driver, being only fed the information of the next collection or drop-off, would have little time to ascertain the context for each passengers\u2019 individual journey. The city would thus become an ever-shifting series of decontextualized vignettes, a constant stream of small tasks in a continually moving vehicle. The perpetual trip reframes the driver as passenger on a journey with no end in sight, and a continual reconfiguration of bodies in each vehicle. My ambition was to recreate the sensation of this journey in filmic form, using scripted software. This was to form the prototypical software which became 24fps Psycho, as well as the basis for an as-yet-unrealised project which further realises the idea.<sup>54</sup></p> <p>Part of the inspiration behind the project came from the Charles and Ray Eames film Powers of Ten.<sup>55</sup> The film, described as \u2018A linear view of our universe from the human scale to the sea of galaxies, then directly down to the nucleus of a carbon atom\u2019 is a meditation on the many scales at which one can view the universe.<sup>56</sup> The \u2018video\u2019 component of the film is a square frame, surrounded by simple infographics displaying the current scale in powers of ten (10<sup>0</sup>, 10<sup>-1</sup>, 10<sup>-2</sup>, etc.). Starting with an aerial view of a man lying on a picnic blanket in a park in Chicago, the camera zooms out at a consistent rate, by a factor of ten times every ten seconds.<sup>57</sup> Thus, in the space of four minutes, the camera has shifted from being 10<sup>0</sup>m (one metre) above the man, to 10<sup>24</sup>m away, with a viewpoint that has passed galaxies, stars, super nova flares, and more. The next instant the camera zooms back in to the man, and repeats the process, this time moving in rather than out, until the camera has reached a 10<sup>-14</sup> metre zoom (0.0001 \u00e5ngstroms), below the scale of atoms, which the narrator describes as the \u2018limits of our understanding\u2019.<sup>58</sup> The film is well-known to architects; in fact, it was written with architects in mind. Within his notes on the film, Charles Eames writes: \u2018Particularly in the past fifty years the world has gradually been finding out something that architects have always known \u2013\u00a0that is, that everything is architecture.\u2019<sup>59</sup></p> Figure 3-30:  Stills from the Powers of Ten showing scales from 100 to 108 metres. Eames, Charles, and Ray Eames. Powers of Ten. Film, 1977. <p>Although best known in filmic form, my first encounter with the film was rather different. Aged six, and passing through a subway station in Mexico City, I was enthralled by large-scale prints on the wall, approximately one every ten metres. Key frames from the film had been laid out in the station so that the experience of the scalar zooming was a spatial one, and the concepts from the film presented in such clear language that a six-year-old could grasp, and remember them. The exhibition made a strong impression, and it was only much later in life that I realised that the images had, in fact, been taken from a film. When I did finally discover the film version of Powers of Ten, I began to wonder how film could be constructed as a spatial entity. I was struck by the way that traditional celluloid film projection relies on a linear, spatialised format where each frame, onscreen for 1/24 of a second, takes up the same amount of room on the spool, and is something that must me \u2018moved through\u2019 before the next frame can be seen. Each frame has fixed dimensions, irrespective of how much \u2018information\u2019 it contains \u2013\u00a0a blank screen requires as much celluloid and takes the same amount of time as the most intricate photograph. The film can only ever move in a linear way, forwards or backwards, much like Turing\u2019s original concept for the Turing Machine.<sup>60</sup> The basic premise of film, that it relies on frames progressing at a rate above that of the human perception of motion, has remained unchanged since Eadward Muybridge\u2019s experiments with photography in the 1880s.<sup>61</sup></p> Figure 3-31:  Working diagram to show how the \u2018Powers of Ten\u2019 was composited. Image source: Charles Eames and Ray Eames, An Eames Anthology: Articles, Film Scripts, Interviews, Letters, Notes, and Speeches, ed. Daniel Ostroff (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2015), 382. Figure 3-36:  Muybridge, Eadweard. The Horse in Motion. Photography, 1878. <p>I wanted the project experiment and play with the spatial qualities that film contained. Often, when immersed in a film, I find myself reminded of other films and scenes \u2013 either by the composition, grading, themes, general \u2018mood\u2019, soundtrack, or any of a number of other signifiers. I started thinking about whether it would be possible to create a filmic version of hypertext, the principle envisioned by Vannevar Bush in 1945 and forming one of the foundations of the internet.<sup>62</sup> I wanted this project to play with the inherent spatiality of film, creating a virtual map on-screen that could be navigated via the playing of films, as if the viewer were passing through space.</p> <p>In order to do this, I needed a criterion by which each film clip would relate to the next, a logic by which to stitch films together. On the perpetual trip, the logic of progression could only ever be spatial: a vehicle moves through a city on a journey planned by an algorithm on a two-dimensional map. Uber vehicles being subject to the use of road maps, cars can only choose from a limited number of options at each junction (e.g. turn left or right, or continue). Traditional film, as projected in cinemas for the past century, is an established and predictable medium: it usually consists of 24 frames being projected sequentially onto a screen per second (commonly known as frames per second, abbreviated to \u2018fps\u2019), whilst one side of a celluloid film strip contains the soundtrack.<sup>63</sup> Celluloid film has a consistent bit-rate of one regularly-sized frame every 24<sup>th</sup> of a second; a twenty-minute long blank film would occupy exactly the same amount of physical space as a twenty-minute segment from a Hollywood film.<sup>64</sup></p> <p>I decided to begin the project by attempting to find similarity between different frames in pre-existing film clips. Similarity is a vague term in computation: there are myriad methods which could be applied to rank images\u2019 similarity to each other (this has long been the case: Marvin Minsky described \u2018the problems of visual pattern-recognition\u2019 as having \u2018received much attention in recent years\u2019 within the field of artificial intelligence in 1961).<sup>65</sup> Not having a formal background in machine learning, I decided to find an arbitrary method for finding similarity in order that I could begin working, and testing (with the intention of later improving my detection mechanisms); I settled with analysing the colour content of film frames, reducing the complexity of images to a simple 3x3 grid. By the time I arrived in Paris, I had built a rough prototype of a scripted programme which would analyse and log the colour content of film frames.<sup>66</sup></p> <p>My initial prototype analysis software, built in Processing, took short film clips, and logged, in real-time, a variety of calculated and measured values for each frame in a film to a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file, including:<sup>67</sup></p> <ul> <li> <p>The red, green and blue (RGB) pixel values for nine points within the image (the central pixel for each rectangle if the screen were divided into a 3x3 grid)</p> </li> <li> <p>Averaged RGB values across the whole image</p> </li> <li> <p>Averaged RGB values across a 3x3 grid</p> </li> <li> <p>Averaged RGB values for the horizontal and vertical middle line of pixels</p> </li> </ul> <p>The basic premise of the software was as a first-stage in the development process: this would enable the creation of a database of pixel values for each frame in a film, which could then be used as a basis for a form of mathematical comparison of film frames for similarity. The software also enabled a graphic interface to preview films that were reduced to 3x3 grid of either averaged pixel values, or the centremost pixel within each of the 3x3 grid rectangles. I was surprised how recognisable film clips were when reduced to this simple grid; I used footage that I had shot of driving over a bridge in Iceland, as well as the famous shower scene from Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s Psycho to demonstrate this principle.<sup>68</sup> I chose these scenes initially simply because I had them to hand whilst I was writing the programme; however, upon showing the demonstration software to an audience, I was struck by just how recognisable the film still was. I also realised that in using a black-and-white film, the level of computation my simple programme would have to perform would be one-third of that of a colour film.</p> Figure 3-37:  Software built in Max by the author to demonstrate principles of animation and experiment with colour analysis. <p>I started to download films from the INA and Prelinger Archives.<sup>69</sup> INA\u2019s research department had granted me access to a collection of their 1940s-1960s newsreels. I particularly liked the aesthetic of the Prelinger Archives: American films, often home movies, public television broadcasts, or corporate films.<sup>70</sup> I used a Python script with the ffmpeg library to split every Prelinger film into its constituent frames, a new version of my Processing script \u2013\u00a0this time rebuilt in Python, using the Pillow image-processing library\u00a0\u2013\u00a0to create a database of the colours within each image. In order to test how closely my system managed to organise similarity, I started to use my databases with Max, and the source film Psycho, to replace each frame in the original film with a \u2018similar\u2019 frame from the Prelinger archives.</p> Figure 3-38:  Early colour analysis experimentation with images from the film Psycho. Hitchcock, Alfred. Psycho. Horror, Mystery, Thriller, 1960. Images by the author. An excerpt of the performance at the Palais de Tokyo\u2019s Do Not Disturb festival can be found in this thesis\u2019s supporting materials. <p>At this stage, I had a meeting Fabien Danesi, a curator at the Palais de Tokyo, who had seen my presentation at the Tokyo Arts Club. I showed him the updated software, and described the ambition I had for the project. He told me about Douglas Gordon\u2019s 1993 installation 24 Hour Psycho, an artwork which served as the setting for, and had been described at length, in the novel Point Omega.<sup>71</sup> In 24 Hour Psycho, Gordon had slowed the film Psycho down to the extent that it took 24 hours to play the entire film (meaning that the film plays at approximately two frames per second); DeLillio\u2019s description of the film, woven throughout the novel, is as a series of images whose meanings have been transformed; every minor inflection made by an actor can be examined in excruciating detail.</p> <p>At this time, working in the gallery\u2019s studio every day, I was acutely aware of the location of the Palais de Tokyo in Paris. It is housed in one of the few remaining buildings in Paris from the 1937 World Exposition. For years the building was empty, serving various (mostly storage) purposes until it re-opened in 2003. Its exterior is a mirror image of the Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, which is housed on the other side of a multi-level courtyard featuring a large colonnade and a pond. In the midst of the conversation with Fabien, we had watched an excerpt of a BBC Documentary about Douglas Gordon made in the 1990s, which featured an interview with the artist on the colonnade, and the installation of work in the museum opposite us.<sup>72</sup> Gordon had, in fact, installed 24 Hour Psycho in the Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne in the year of its creation.<sup>73</sup></p> <p>By this time, it had become apparent that the computational work required to translate the notion of the perpetual trip into film in the manner I wished within the period of my artist residency; it would require significant investment in machine learning skills. The data operation to choose the most appropriate match to that currently onscreen, from a potential pool of millions of images, 24 times a second, is complex, and was in hindsight beyond my skills at the time. However, I was keen to develop and show a version of the project, and had received positive feedback after demonstrating the prototype software in November. Fabien proposed that my version of the frame-replacement software could be shown in the Do Disturb festival. I decided that using Psycho as a base film would work; in the tests I\u2019d worked on in the studio, large portions of the film remained legible, both after the original images were reduced to a 3x3 grid of greys, and then after my image-replacement algorithm had been used.</p> <p>I worked on 24fps Psycho in between multiple other projects (86,400, Network / Intersect, and Scriptych), in multiple countries. Most of the coding took place during the month-long stay in Korea, whilst editing and setting up Network/Intersect for installation at the Seoul Museum of Art (see chapter 4). The installation date for Network/Intersect was the 30<sup>th</sup> March 2016, and the opening was on the 5<sup>th</sup> April. It required editing until the last minute. I flew back to Paris the morning after the opening, and worked on 24fps Psycho for its performances on the 9<sup>th</sup> to the 11<sup>th</sup> April. I use the term \u2018performance\u2019 here because the process behind the film was a performance; the computation all took place in near real-time, and each screening was different.</p> <p>The setup of the performances was as follows. The performances took place in the Palais de Tokyo\u2019s Salle 37, an art deco cinema room dating back to the gallery\u2019s construction. Three screens occupied the room; on the central screen, the film Psycho was projected onto the central screen. After the title sequence, the image became \u2018pixelated\u2019 into smaller and smaller resolutions, until after four seconds, the screen simply showed a 3x3 grid with the average colours from the nine equal areas onscreen. The resulting colours were then used to query the database I had collated of the frames from all of the Prelinger Archive films. The image that was most similar to these averages was then displayed, in black-and-white on the two screens to either side of the main screen.</p> <p>The first screening, however, was a disaster. The cinema projection booth had been refurbished multiple times, and was wildly impractical; where most projection booths have a means of viewing the screen they are projecting onto, this area had at some point been bricked up; viewing the screens could only be achieved by climbing onto the desk in the booth. My allocated screening times were between other performances and film screenings, and there was a very short setup time. Because the processing was happening live (and could change each time it was screened), the performance relied on the use of a high-powered iMac that the Pavillon studio owned. However, the rigging company who had been brought in to install AV equipment had not brought the appropriate adaptors (despite having had a comprehensive tech setup runt-though the day before), so at the last minute, instead of checking each part of my set-up methodically, I spent the entire time trying to locate an adaptor, then reconfiguring the specialist software I had to use to interface with the projectors. At this time, the technicians all disappeared. The screening restarted several times due to a string of technical errors. At one point, as it became clear that there was an issue with the projection interface, I had to write a patch during the performance.<sup>74</sup> Part of the nature of work that involves experimental computation involves accepting a degree of technical error; however, I have never had such a catalogue of issues with a single project. The sensation of such a failure is crushing.</p> <p>By the time of the next screening, however, I had been able to robustly rebuild almost the entire project to be more resilient in case of an error such as projector failure. Being subject to what felt like every possible failure made the second performance far better. Since the software had been extensively rebuilt, it was also my first chance to see the film the entire way through (I had worked on selected sections before), and I became a member of the audience in the screening room. The imagery, although not continually updating at 24 frames per second (due to memory lags) did have a beguiling effect similar to 86400. Although no image existed onscreen for long enough to perceive in its entirety, different frames from the same films featured onscreen repeatedly; one motif repeated was a Richard Nixon press conference, and many distinctively 1950s-60s elements of American life appeared onscreen. Initially overwhelming to watch, the barrage of continually changing images, faster than comprehension would allow, became a steady stream of noise; the difference between individual images became a constant, removing the perception of difference.</p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch3/#project-learnings","title":"Project learnings","text":"<p>This chapter presented two projects which both exclusively used computer scripting and archival content to create new films. An important part of the way that I work is to continually experiment with new media and materials, and it is inevitable that sometimes these experiments do not work in the way that I would like. This was the case with 24fps Psycho. However, I did learn a lot from the project.</p> <p>One of the problems with the project was the conflation of ideas which caused the focus of the work to shift. What started as a piece of test footage (the film Psycho) became the core focus of the work; rather than being a project trying to create an endless film, creating a metaphor for the experience of a perpetually travelling driver, it became software that overlaid new content onto the top of an existing film. The formal quality of the film did partially hint at the absurd. At the screenings of 24fps Psycho, much of the content of the original film was included: the distinctive soundtrack, with its score by Bernard Herrmann, as well as the colour content, albeit in pixelated form. When confronted with these elements, as well as the new images being projected alongside, the audience attempted to find meaning in the entire assemblage. Inevitably, the experience was incomprehensible; the stream of imagery was relentless and unrelated to the film itself (besides the visual similarity of 1950s/1960s American films). The experience was ultimately meaningless \u2013 which is a partial absurd success.</p> <p>The film also highlighted the Batesonian ideas of noise and difference. Initially, confronted with the baffling, continuous reel of images, experiencing the film was tiresome. However, after a few moments the content of the imagery ceased to be tiring; my mind had realised that the imagery was all noise, rather than information. I was surprised to find that 86400 is actually more challenging to watch, as its framerate of one image per second is just long enough to make connections between one image and another, whereas the images in 24fps Psycho begin to merge into one another very quickly.</p> <p>One of the major compromises in 24fps Psycho was the quality of the computational processes themselves. It became apparent early on that the computational techniques required to create a similarity-seeking computational script which would be recognisable to a person, rather than a machine, were too advanced for the level of programming knowledge I had at the time. I have since learnt a number of technical skills which would have made the project far more computationally viable. The continuous technical errors that struck the first performance were crushing; however, this is also a reflection of the fragility of working in a purely computational medium. Whilst creating work of this nature is enjoyable, there is a lack of tangibility which feels restrictive with purely digital projects; there is no object or thing to point to once the performance is done. The platform-dependence of working with computer scripts is also a shortcoming of the medium: the files used to create the piece will likely not function in a few years\u2019 time.</p> <p>I do not feel as though I fulfilled the original brief I set myself with this project, of exploring the sensation of being a perpetual trip driver. As experimentation is part of my working practice, so is a lack of \u2018closure\u2019, particularly when I do not feel an idea has been resolved. The framework of 24fps Psycho, and the skills that I have learnt from the project, will inevitably find their way into new works in the future.</p> <p>However, by providing User Content to Uber, you grant Uber a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use, copy, modify, create derivative works of, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, and otherwise exploit in any manner such User Content in all formats and distribution channels now known or hereafter devised (including in connection with the Services and Uber\u2019s business and on third-party sites and services), without further notice to or consent from you, and without the requirement of payment to you or any other person or entity.

Swarms have also served as paradigmatic analogues for the field concept: swarms of buildings that drift across the landscape. There are no platonic, discrete figures or zones with sharp outlines. Within fields only regional field qualities matter: biases, drifts, gradients, and perhaps conspicuous singularities such as radiating centres. Deformation no longer spells the breakdown of order, but the inscription of information. Orientation in a complex, differentiated field affords navigation along vectors of transformation. The contemporary condition of arriving in a metropolis for the first time, without prior hotel arrangements and without a map, might instigate this kind of field-navigation. Imagine there are no more landmarks to hold on to, no axes to follow, no more boundaries to cross. Patrik Schumacher, \u2018Parametricism: A New Global Style\u2019, in Digital Cities AD, ed.

For the sake of reducing file sizes, modern digital film formats such as h.264 or .avi often only encode a keyframe as a complete image, and changes from one frame to the next, rather than a series of individual frames. This means that unlike their analogue equivalents, where every frame occupies the same amount of space, compressed digital films rarely have a consistent bitrate. Whilst it is possible to encode films as a stream of images, the conventions of lossy image compression formats, such as JPEG, mean that each image itself has a different file size. Within digital cinema photography, many of the professional cameras, manufactured by companies such as RED and BlackMagic, offer the option to shoot film as a series of uncompressed RAW images; this gives film-makers greater flexibility to make edits in post-production, and is a digital equivalent of shooting on celluloid.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Marvin Minsky, \u2018Steps toward Artificial Intelligence\u2019, Proceedings of the IRE 49, no. 1 (January 1961): 11, doi:10.1109/JRPROC.1961.287775.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>This was presented to an audience at the launch of the Pavillon residency programme at the Palais de Tokyo\u2019s Tokyo Arts Club evening on 25<sup>th</sup> November 2015.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>CSV files are a lightweight means to store arrays of information, akin to a spreadsheet.

Entitled The Drowned Man: A Hollywood Fable, the performance took place in a large 5-storey building, formerly a Royal Mail sorting office, next to London Paddington station.<sup>1</sup> Each member of the audience was given an identical white mask to wear, and during the performance was free to roam the set of a \u2018town\u2019 which had been constructed inside the warehouse to mimic the outskirts of early 1960s Hollywood. The audience could walk in and out of houses, pick objects up, read letters, look in drawers, and follow the (unmasked) performers around as their characters went about their fictional lives.</p> <p>The performers' scripts led them in a highly choreographed journey around the entire building, from one floor to another, from the David Lynch-styled nightclub and the Foley studio in the basement to the shops, bar and cinema on another, to another's film sets, or the top floors' desert and chapel. The audience would individually choose a character to follow, witness their interaction with another character \u2013\u00a0for example, a fight\u00a0\u2013 then have to choose which character they wanted to follow next as the two ran off in opposite directions. Or, they could follow nobody, and just explore the world that Punchdrunk had created. The whole time, a spatialised soundtrack played throughout the set, different in each area, featuring fragments and sections of songs and film scores. This served a number of functions: to create a cinematic atmosphere, to 'narrate' and provide soundtrack to scenes within the play, and to give the performers subtle audio cues. The play featured little spoken dialogue from its actors, instead relying on movement, gesture, and physical interactions.</p> <p>Wearing a mask, which limited my peripheral vision, whilst exploring a highly detailed world, and witnessing interactions between actors, yet not being able to interact \u2013\u00a0even being anonymised by a mask myself \u2013 felt somewhere between watching a film and playing a sophisticated video game. After the two and a half hours of the performance, I had picked up fragments of several storylines, but had experienced something that was at once beguiling, intriguing, alienating and immensely enjoyable. In short, I felt punch-drunk. I saw the production several times in order to decode its mechanics.</p> <p>The play was in fact highly choreographed. It featured multiple intertwining narratives, and around 30 actors, mostly with dance or physical theatre backgrounds, going about their lives in 1960s Hollywood. The play had a looping structure, with each 'scene' being approximately 5 minutes long, and the characters running their entire \u2018loop\u2019 multiple times per performance. The storylines for the characters included young actors trying to break into the movie business, exploitative studio executives, spurned lovers, a starlet\u2019s demotion to a non sex-symbol role, and at least one murder. Although there was a high number of characters physically inhabiting the set, there were many more hinted at through the design of the set itself. Each character had a set of spaces that they \u2018belonged to\u2019, which were laid out and filled with artefacts which reflected their personalities. This was highly exaggerated, and taken to absurd levels in some cases; the vein starlet's dressing room featured about twenty mirrors all angled to look at her; comically large piles of chicken-wire cages filled one characters' office; a caravan was filled with angst-ridden handwritten letters and actors' headshots; the security guard's office was filled with a huge number of orchids and plants.</p> <p>The thing I found striking about the play was the manner by which the design of the space reflected the perspectives of its characters. It seemed to reflect Bateson\u2019s statement that \u2018human beings operate more easily in a universe where some of their psychological characteristics are externalised.\u2019<sup>2</sup> Had I not even seen the play, the space itself would have been able to hint at a number of the storylines that would take place inside it. I found myself determined to carry out a project in which the design of a characters' environment to reflect their own beliefs and motivations would play a major role.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>Italo Calvino expressed a similar idea in the chapter of his book If on a winter's night a traveler... entitled In a network of lines that intersect.<sup>4</sup> The entire book is an experiment in form; every second chapter is an unrelated \u2018first chapter\u2019 from a different genre of book, based in a different culture, and written in the first-person perspective by a character whose internal state of mind is reflected in their environment. In a network of lines that intersect is told from the perspective of a businessman who sees the financial and business world as a large optical device. Using metaphors about mirrors and reflections, the character describes his shady and somewhat paranoid methods of financial deception:</p> <p>They [^other businessmen] don't know that I have built my financial empire on the very principle of kaleidoscopes and catoptric instruments, multiplying, as if in a play of mirrors, companies without capital, enlarging credit, making disastrous deficits vanish in the dead corners of illusory perspectives. My secret, the secret of my uninterrupted financial victories in a period that has seen market crashes and bankruptcies, has always been this: that I never thought of money, business, profits, but only of the angles of refraction established among shining surfaces variously inclined.<sup>5</sup></p> <p>Calvino, like Punchdrunk, creates a world for his character to inhabit that reflects his internal mind-set and motivations. This particular story culminates in the character becoming lost in his own hall of mirrors, his identity merging with that of those was trying to deceive; the lens through which he saw the world became his own downfall.</p> <p>As discussed in earlier chapters, Calvino was well known for his experiments in form, both before and during his time as an Oulipian. The extreme constraints he placed on the form of his work in If on a winters night a traveler\u2026 spanned from the style of writing and entire world-view shifting completely every other chapter, to the overall structure of the book, which follows a rule of thematic inversion: the last chapter was an inversion of the first, and so on. These ideas of constrained, \u2018scripted\u2019 processes (following a ruleset in order to create works) were another element I wanted to explore as a creative tool within a project, following the trajectory of projects presented in this thesis that all use the idea of the \u2018script\u2019 (computer scripting / scripted performance / scripted design process) in one or more ways. This chapter presents the final project, and the prototypical instance of what I term \u2018Reflexive Scripted Design.\u2019</p> <p>Part of the inspiration for the \u2018Reflective Scripted Design\u2019 process came from a workshop I attended in Punchdrunk\u2019s studios.<sup>6</sup> Run by designers Hebe George and Maita Jobbe Duval, who had both worked on The Drowned Man, and held on the set itself, the workshop explored design process that Punchdrunk had used in the creation of the play. One of the main things I took away was their approach to writing their performance scripts. Punchdrunk's plays are reactive to the empty buildings they are set in; the directors of the company spend time alone in a potential building before any of rest of the company see it working out what it could potentially contain. They claim not to have pre-set ideas when they 'acquire' a new property, but rather use a creative process based on intuition to guide their work.</p> <p>Each play is a synthesis of three elements: two 'primary texts' and a place and time. In the case of The Drowned Man, the primary texts were Georg Bu\u0308chner\u2019s unfinished play Woyzeck and Nathaniel West's The Day of the Locust, whilst the place and time was early 1960s Hollywood and the surrounding areas.<sup>7</sup> The synthesis of three elements creates something novel, and doesn't force the writers to lean too heavily on any one element. Once I had learnt of this technique, it seemed that it was a mode of scripting a process much in line with my research interests. I had long wanted to work on a project which would similarly create a set of worlds that reflected the internal state of characters, yet also serve as criticism of larger sociological or technical \u2018machines\u2019. Calvino\u2019s businessman was a compelling character whose world offered promise: key to the next stage of the project would be to find other abstracted world-views.</p> Figure 4-39:  One of the videos made by the propagandists Chen discusses in his article, alledgedly showing an Ebola patient being removed for quarantine from Atlanta airport (but likely filmed in Russia). Note the attention to detail: the truck parked in the garage has an Atlanta Airport decal prominently placed in-shot. Stone, Jeremy. Infected with Ebola in Atlanta Airport, 13 December, 2014. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqsA71C6BDc. Accessed 5 May 2017. <p>Soon after reading Calvino\u2019s novel, I became interested in the similar, but differenct form of abstracted world-view emerging forms of Russian propaganda which were being reported in British and American press.<sup>8</sup> A pair of articles in the New York Times and the Guardian in 2015 present an interesting image of state-sponsored Russian propaganda in the 21st Century. In the New York Times article The Agency, investigative journalist Adrien Chen examines a propaganda agency whose aim is to create uncertainty on the internet, using social media, blogs, and online videos.<sup>9</sup> Workers at the St. Petersberg-based Internet Research Agency (IRA) create and curate false avatars who inhabit online space. Many of these avatars run blogs, comment on news articles, and display a high level of interaction with each other, frequently commenting on each others\u2019 blog posts, mentioning each other in tweets, and so on \u2013\u00a0creating the illusion that these avatars belong to a natural, organic community. In addition, they create false accounts of events that never happened. In the story's opening anecdote, the avatars create a social media frenzy around a fictitious chemical fire in a small town in Louisiana, using websites such as Twitter to \u2018report\u2019 on the situation in real-time, contact real local officials, and act as if the event had really happened. Other fabricated events Chen described include a racially motivated shooting, and an Ebola outbreak at Atlanta airport. The Ebola outbreak is particularly notable for the level of detail in its supporting media:</p> <p>A YouTube video showed a team of hazmat-suited medical workers transporting a victim from the airport. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s recent single \u201c7/11\u201d played in the background, an apparent attempt to establish the video\u2019s contemporaneity. A truck in the parking lot sported the logo of the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.<sup>10</sup></p> <p>This, Chen argues, is not normal propaganda. The motives behind this new mode of false information are intriguing, and something that British-Russian journalist Peter Pomerantsev investigates further in the Guardian article Inside the Kremlin's Hall of Mirrors.<sup>11</sup> One aspect of the contemporary Russian propaganda efforts, Pomerantsev explains, is to sew stories of falsehoods in every possible media outlet, from the internet to the state-sponsored Russia Today TV channel (known as RT). The initial aim is to create a distrust in the media. However, Pomerantsev relates the overall effort back to a Russian field operations manual called Information-Psychological War Operations: A Short Encyclopaedia and Reference Guide, which he quotes:</p> <p>\u201cThere are two possible approaches to information war,\u201d the encyclopedia states. The first approach \u201crecognises the primacy of objects in the real world\u201d and attempts to spin them in a favourable or unfavourable direction. The \u201cmore strategic\u201d approach, it continues, \u201cputs information before objects\u201d. In other words, the encyclopedia seems to be saying that reality can be reinvented.<sup>12</sup></p> <p>This is a powerful image: the idea that by spreading mistruths, the fabric of reality can be undermined.<sup>13</sup> I began to think about the workers that Chen describes at the IRA: what do they think about the work they carry out, and how does it feel to be sewing untruths for a living? In the article, Chen describes the daily routine of the workers via a former worker he interviews; he witnesses the staff exit and enter their workplace end masse at the beginning and end of their 12-hour shifts. Knowing anything beyond the immediate task to hand, I thought, would imply that either the workers are highly cynical, or that they adopt a similarly abstract worldview to the character in the Italo Calvino story.</p> Figure 4-40:  The office building alleged to be a propaganda producer in St. Petersberg, Russia. Photo from Google Street View. Google Maps (2016). Retrieved from https://goo.gl/maps/1wspzB4Ef7v. <p>These issues of control, and how they affect personal freedoms, bring me to a pair of related theoretical writings: Felix Guttari's Postscript on the Societies of Control and Nathan Moore's Diagramming Control.<sup>14</sup> Moore\u2019s chapter builds on the central argument of Postscript on the Societies of Control \u2013 a work that proposes that Western society has moved beyond the Foucauldian idea of \u2018disciplinary societies\u2019 (epitomised by the diagram of the Panopticon), and towards \u2018societies of control\u2019 where power is increasingly abstracted and norms are ever-shifting.<sup>15</sup> Moore has an interesting perspective on this argument: he is a lawyer who is interested in the concept of control, yet also has an interest in the built environment.<sup>16</sup> His chapter aims to create spatial metaphors that enable the reader to create diagrams of control systems, so that a layer of abstraction is removed and they may be discussed in a spatial plane.</p> <p>In the summer of 2015, the photographer Max Colson and myself were invited to run a workshop by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) and UCL Urban Lab. The workshop was entitled Virtual Control, and was timed and themed to accompany an exhibition of the same title Colson was showing at RIBA (which also featured one of my art pieces).<sup>17</sup> We took a group comprising approximately 12 members of the public and RIBA members on a guided walk from Stratford Underground Station in London, through the Westfield East Shopping centre and to the recently-opened Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Colson and I wanted to encourage these members of the public to engage with these newly constructed \u2018public-private partnerships\u2019 and investigate the implicit rules and associated behaviours that the spaces generated through a series of structured conversations \u2013\u00a0essentially, to question to what extent Guttari's Control Society had been embodied in these new built forms.<sup>18</sup> One of the attendees was Moore; the conversations that we had on the day, and the email correspondence that followed, was of great interest to me. We discussed how the Westfield Shopping Centre in its architectural and interior design was a dense informational system which (whether it had been designed this way or otherwise) existed for the purpose of conveying meaningless messages. It presents the visitor with a seemingly endless array of novelty, creating continual confusion and causing its visitors to lose their grip on the meaning of their environment \u2013\u00a0and thus, causing them to buy more goods.<sup>19</sup> The metaphor about Westfield was similar to that found in the articles on Russian propaganda, and a similar sleight-of-hand technique to that used by the character in the Italo Calvino story.</p> <p>The ideas I had been exploring would find a concise application once I began my residency at the Palais de Tokyo. In November 2015, the Palais de Tokyo\u2019s curator Fabien Danesi and Seoul Museum of Art\u2019s (SeMA) Gahee Park told the 6 artists in the programme about a group show they would be curating at SeMA. They wanted us to each create a new work that in some way tied in with their exhibition title Urban Legends, and if possible, made some reference to Korea. The budget allocated was \u20ac3000 per artist, and the exhibition would open in April 2016. As part of the programme, the artists would also spend a month in Seoul in advance of the show.</p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch4/#network-intersect","title":"Network / Intersect","text":"<p>Due to the constraints of the exhibition format, its timescale, and budget, I decided that the best option would be to make a film. My time would be split between this and several other projects (86400, 24fps Psycho, and Scriptych). From the date we were given the brief, there were around 4 months until the journey to Korea; one month in Seoul; then the exhibition. Based on the time constraints, and the inevitable difficulty of producing an ambitious work in a new country where I was unable to speak the language, I decided that all filming would have to take place in Paris.</p> <p>The limited budget meant that sets had to be produced cheaply, or filming would take place in public places where no permits or permission had to be sought. The budget would also limit the available crew; I could afford to pay a limited number of actors, but also had the assistance of staff at the Pavillon: Justine Emard, a practising artist and photographer, and Justine Hermant and Chloe Fricout, who would both assist with production.</p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch4/#rules","title":"Rules","text":"<p>I chose to adapt the method I had learnt from Punchdrunk to determine the content: the subject matter would be inspired by the stories of Russian internet propaganda and Italo Calvino's In a network of lines that intersect; the place and time would be a contemporary Seoul. However, the practical constraints of not being in Seoul made shooting there within the time-frame impossible. In addition to the adapted Punchdrunk technique, I created a basic ruleset which I would use to make decisions throughout the project, about every aspect of the production, from its inception to the film editing.</p> <p>The rules were:</p> <ol> <li> <p>The form of the film must reflect its content</p> </li> <li> <p>Techniques of the Russian Internet Research Agency must be used where possible</p> </li> <li> <p>The film must be set in Seoul</p> </li> <li> <p>All filming must take place in Paris</p> </li> </ol> <p>Some of these were chosen for thematic reasons: introducing creative constraints to form and content, much like the Oulipian rules; some of the rules were for practical reasons (but also posed creative constraints). All of the rules were decided as a result of careful research, and a reflection of my own attitudes towards the subjects. Thus, I call this process of rule-creation \u2018Reflexive Scripted Design.\u2019 The term \u2018reflexive\u2019 is used as an adjective in two ways. Firstly, like Oulipian works, it focuses attention on the process and production of work, so that the rules themselves become part of the defining fabric of the project.<sup>20</sup> Secondly, it acknowledges the role of the author in the creation of work which responds to subjects; the author becomes innately aware that the arbitrary rules created early on may have effects on the form and content of the work later, and thus the perception of the subject matter.<sup>21</sup> \u2018Scripted\u2019 refers to the rules which are created. In using this term, I consciously embrace its myriad meanings and inherent contradictions, giving a degree of freedom to the author: like the director of a play, they can choose the level of leniency they give themselves to interpret their own rules. The rules should be created as a result of research into the subjects, places, and potentially characters to be integrated into the work, and in some way \u2018site\u2019 the project (as the Paris-Seoul relation did in this project).</p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch4/#form","title":"Form","text":"<p>The project described in this chapter serves as the prototype for this design process. Once the rules had been established, the most important thing to establish was the form the film would take. Being a film synthesising two inter-related themes, I decided to display the film on 2 screens side-by-side, with the idea that two films would be synchronised to show similar aesthetic content whilst discussing contrasting but complementary subject matters.<sup>22</sup> The film would focus on two characters: one inspired by Calvino's businessman, the other a worker in a propaganda agency responsible for a network of avatars. Central to the propaganda agency worker's job is the adopting of multiple personas and viewpoints in their 12-hour days.<sup>23</sup> In order to carry out this task, I decided that my character would have to adopt a mode of thinking similar to that Pomerantsev describes; to believe that reality is an illusion, and that their work is meritorious in its role in pointing this out. The mode of exploring both characters would be through showing their routines and the environments they inhabited, both of which would reflect the internal states of the characters.</p> <p>The characters would also balance each other visually; one sees themselves as a master of their own destiny and is the director of a network of companies, whilst the other is low-ranking within a chaotic, and ever-moving organisation.<sup>24</sup> I named the characters M and W, letters whose capitals are the inverse of one another. M \u2013\u00a0based on the Calvino character \u2013\u00a0would appear in the centre of the screen where possible, with low-angle cameras to imply their dominant position. Their environment would be luxurious, executive: travelling by chauffeur-driven car, meeting in marble-lined buildings and boardrooms full of dark wooden furniture. W would travel by public transport and work in an increasingly messy cubicle in a generic office building. The visual inspiration for W was largely inspired by the films of Kaufman; an atmosphere of shoddiness and chaos.<sup>25</sup> Like most Kaufman films, many Theatre of the Absurd plays, and the Calvino story, the films would also be entropic. The central motif of both storylines would be the disintegration of the characters' sense of self caused by the abstracted lenses through which they see the world.</p> Figure 4-41:  Shot plans for Network / Intersect and the corresponding scenes in the film. Photo and drawings by the author. <p>Since the central motif of Calvino's story is that of the mirror (the businessman has built his empire on the idea of mirrors), the films would also mirror each other \u2013\u00a0one playing forwards, whilst the other played backwards. Once they came to their end, or beginning, the direction of both films would reverse, so that the film that had previously been playing backwards would play forwards, and the previously forwards film would play backwards.<sup>26</sup> However, this came with a challenge: in the pair of films, each one's chaotic end would have to segue into the others' ordered beginning.</p> <p>These chaotic endings would differ for both characters, based on their world-views and their particular line of work, but both would revolve around issues of identity and their sense of self. W, whose character transforms into myriad personalities per day in the confines of the office for the purposes of living virtual lives online, would find these invented characters invading his non-work life; to borrow terminology from Deleuze and Guttari (via Manuel de Landa), the virtualities he created online would merge into his actuality, blurring the line between his lived reality and the fictions he creates.<sup>27</sup> The film would show W\u2019s daily routine becoming slowly more confused and absurd, culminating in him repeating lines of fiction to narrate his lived experience; simultaneously, he would be seen wearing distinctive costume from his characters in daily life, visually symbolising this transition. M, on the other hand, explains his business dealings in terms of mirrors and lenses, as if his whole business empire were a large machine for the creation and manipulation of images. During the film, he extends this metaphor to describe a technique he uses to ensure clients empathise and identify with him:</p> <p>I imagine myself behind a one-way mirror \u2013 so that when they look at me, they see themselves: their moves and mannerisms, their hopes &amp; dreams. The whole time my true motivations remain hidden \u2013 even from myself.</p> <p>Much like the character in Calvino\u2019s story becomes trapped in his own hall of mirrors, M becomes victim to his techniques of hiding his emotions and motivations. He develops an inability to distinguish between his own mirror image and other people, his speech merging with that of his clients in a confused, parabolic mess. The film should convey the impression that M is somewhere between mirrored self-misidentification and a Fregoli disorder.<sup>28</sup> The two storylines feature similar forms of self-identity crisis, but resolve in different ways.</p> <p>This would also mean that both films would have to be filmed with a mind to their appearance both forwards and backwards simultaneously. It took several attempts to devise a means to diagram the shots of both films in a way that ensured they could share thematic elements and transitions in both directions simultaneously. The eventual result had two main elements: a timing system, and a diagram system.</p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch4/#timing","title":"Timing","text":"<p>The overall film length was to be 512 seconds; this meant each film would be 256 seconds long. I chose this time increment for two reasons:</p> <ol> <li> <p>W works primarily on computers. Computer memory works on a base-2 system;<sup>29</sup> 256 and 512 are numbers synonymous with computing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Both numbers are divisible in the base-2 system; therefore the film could be divided into 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 or 64 second chunks. I settled on 4 seconds after doing a few screen tests. 2 seconds is too short; 8 seconds is too long. This does not mean that all shots must be four seconds, but rather a multiple of four seconds.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch4/#diagram","title":"Diagram","text":"<p>I developed a diagram system to plan shots within the films. This consisted of two landscape pieces of paper, of equal length, which had measurements printed across the bottom from one side to each other \u2013 one line to represent each four seconds of the film (256s total). The paper also had an arrow pointing left to right to signal its direction. Transitions would have to occur at 4-second markers. Read left-to-right, the storyboard acted like a film timeline. Turning the other storyboard upside-down and placing its timeline in line with the other film ensured that what was happening on one storyboard at a certain time could be synchronised with the storyboard on the other screen as well. Time could be effectively segmented into usable shot-lists.</p> <p>My initial storyboards divided the timelines into equal-sized \"chunks\", portraying one day in the life of each character (so the films would, for example, both feature 4 64-second 'sections', each one representing a day in the characters' life). However, playing through storyboard simulations in film-editing software with script read-throughs showed that these felt like artificial constraints on natural story-telling. If each 'day' onscreen was the same length as the others, it would be hard to draw attention to any particular element as the focus of a story). The 4-second shot rule (or multiple thereof) was, however, kept in place; this enabled and enforced a modular filming style whereby each shot had a minimum of 4 seconds on-screen. When working with actors, they would be given directions for the next 4-20 seconds immediately before filming, echoing the modular way in which I envisioned W's character working in the propaganda agency ('picking up' and 'putting down' multiple personas per day).</p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch4/#workflow","title":"Workflow","text":"<p>The descriptions of editing and audio techniques above reflect one crucial part of the design process: workflow. A major part of film-making is the discipline and planning one puts into one's workflow: having a framework in place to shoot, gather footage, review, rate, collate and edit a film. In the case of this project, whereby the form of the project and its outcome was being determined in advance by a scripted design process, this was even more important. The operations to shoot two films simultaneously, both of which must be played both forwards and backwards, are complex. Another crucial limitation was the film's budget: I could only afford to pay the actors for a small number of shooting days (4 per actor) and there was only one day where both actors would be in the same place at the same time. The logistics of the editing operation were worked out in advance of any shooting, and multiple attempts to edit and export 'dummy' footage were tested to improve the system.</p> <p>One of the main editing restrictions was the capabilities of editing software on my computer.<sup>30</sup> Although my computer has relatively high specifications for film editing, the challenge of editing 2 high definition films in opposing directions was one with intrinsic practical issues; rendering previews of reversed film is still something that takes time. The following workflow was devised for film exports.</p> <p>The final film consists of two 1920x1080 films, side by side. However, the films were edited individually, then exported as assets which were then imported into a third, master timeline. This timeline simply positioned a film file called w_latest.mov on the left, and m_latest.mov on the right. Because the films were pre-compressed (and could be exported at low resolution as they were simply to check timing of shots in editing), they could be reversed on the timeline easily. When it came to mastering the films, I simply had to export high resolution versions of W and M as w_latest.mov and m_latest.mov, then export the master film (which would collate these two films) at high resolution. The structure of the film, with the 4-second \u2018chunks\u2019, proved to create a highly restrictive editing technique. This meant that there are a few sections of the film where the pacing is not as it may have been had I been able to work outside of the confines of the scripted design process, but these limitations do reflect the working methodology of Calvino and the Oulipo.</p> <p>In order to plan shots, and be able to work confidently and efficiently when actually filming, I created diagrams detailing the optical angles and focus lengths of every camera I had access to. I also shot test footage in every location that I would later use. This would enable me to plan shots more effectively for shooting.</p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch4/#internet-research-agency-techniques","title":"Internet Research Agency Techniques","text":"<p>Besides the technical aspects of film-making, a major component of this project was the use of techniques inspired by the Internet Research Agency. Chen reports that the last known address of the IRA was in a nondescript office building in St Petersburg, yet their workers, assumed to be near-exclusively Russian, make videos and write blogs that purport to be from America.<sup>31</sup> Chen's example of a video supposedly shot in Atlanta airport gains legitimacy through the positioning of a truck in the video with Atlanta airport decals. Rules 2, 3 and 4 of the project stated that the film must use IRA techniques, and be shot in Paris but set in Seoul. By shooting in Paris-as-Seoul, I was also fulfilling the IRA technique: in the same way that it could be assumed that most of the IRA workers had not visited the USA, I had at that time not visited Korea. Therefore, like the IRA workers, I would have to use the tools of the internet \u2013\u00a0Google Street View, Flickr, Google Translate, and more \u2013\u00a0to learn what my version of Seoul should be.</p> <p>One step towards creating a fake Seoul was to find the people to inhabit it: the actors to play W and M. I had, for the first time, budget to pay actors, so set about placing adverts written in Korean and English in the artist residences where I lived, on Facebook and the internet. Through a network of contacts, I managed to gain enough applicants to hold auditions, and chose to cast two actors: Hokyoung Kim, a Korean actor visiting Paris and looking for work, and Patrick Ng, a Hong-Kong-Dutch actor.<sup>32</sup></p> <p>The easiest film to shoot in a fake Korea would be M, an executive who would be seen riding in chauffer-driven cars and in luxury offices. Interiors of offices would be filmed in the Palais de Tokyo; in sets I would construct in the the Pavillon studio, and on the marble staircase of the 1937 building. One shot in particular \u2013 of M descending a staircase \u2013 echoes the Russian Constructivist photographer Aleksandr Rodchenko's The Stairs.<sup>33</sup></p> <p>Much of M's routine involves travel in the back of a car. This meant that I had to have several shots of 4-20 seconds' length of M in a car. The camera would be positioned low down, between the two front seats, facing up at M, who would be seated in the centre of the rear seat. The budget of the film would not allow for executive car hire, so I used Uber Executive (a taxi service providing executive cars) for a journey from the Palais de Tokyo to Pont Louis Philippe bridge. I spent time in advance searching for a journey that would feature tunnels similar to those I had seen on Google Street View of Seoul; this journey ensured that the driver would take the express road by the river that was also away from the distinctly Parisian buildings we would pass (the low camera angle would also mask our true location). This journey would also take us to the bridge where the intersection shot could be filmed (the actor playing W, plus the two assistants followed us in a second Uber Executive taxi, which we would use to shoot the transition shot, around 25 minutes later).<sup>34</sup></p> <p>Unlike M, W's character is a low-level employee, ill-compensated for their work, travelling by crowded public transport to a shoddy, generic office with a temporary for a gruelling 12-hour shift.<sup>35</sup> The buildings he inhabits would be generic, slightly run-down; I also wanted to include a Kaufman-esque office that would deteriorate in reflection of the characters' identity breakdown. The shots of W travelling to work would be shot on the Paris Metro system, but with masks similar to the ones the IRA used on their \u2018Atlanta Airport\u2019 truck to disguise it. The Parisian Metro is particularly visually distinctive, with many trains having doors which require manual opening, as well as a number of 'themed' stations.<sup>36</sup> I chose to film on Line 1, whose relatively modern trains (and their doors) are automated, and whose interiors featured long illuminated panels onto which fake Korean subway maps could be attached.<sup>37</sup></p> <p>I designed four sets of maps, which originally were intended to feature in four scenes of the film (however, in later editing this was reduced to one map). The station names, written in Korean, were in fact partial sentences taken from Moore\u2019s Diagramming Control, and translated into Korean using Google Translate. All of the shots on the Paris Metro would be taken with a short-focus lens, and feature a close-up of the \u2018Korean\u2019 Metro map, followed by a pan to W's character arriving in a station, then following him as he leaves the train and turns right to walk down the platform. Whilst filming, we would then both run to get back onto the train, re-entering in a loop so that we could film the next scene at the next station without losing the map.</p> Figure 4-43:  Appropriating propagandist techniques on the Paris Metro: affixing maps to the overhead illuminated panels.

Note the K of \u2018Korea Transport\u2019 logo is the symbol for a plane mirror reflecting light, hinting at M\u2019s character. By the author. <p>Another part of the Parisian Metro to feature heavily in the film was Ch\u00e2talet des Halles station. When I had first moved to Paris, I had taken note of Ch\u00e2talet's long travellator.<sup>38</sup> It was as notable for its length (around 300 metres)\u00a0as well as its unusual form; a horizontal section with a high ceiling is contrasted halfway along with a curved incline and a low ceiling. During the time I was resident in Paris, Ch\u00e2talet was also being refurbished, and the travellator had a series of exposed beams above it: the unnaturally steady movement of a camera on the travellator combined with the exposed building innards would make a perfect texture for a film about a person who is experiencing a sense of detachment from their surroundings. The same short-focus lens was used as for the Metro train shots, and green, municipal-style posters were stuck to the side of the travellator every 10 metres or so that said \u2018Remember: You're in Korea\u2019. I liked this idea because it was so absurd; I have never seen a poster to remind an audience which country they're in. In the film, W's character looks at the poster at exactly the moment his voiceover dialogue says \u201cHow can we trust anything when solidity itself is an illusion?\u201d The posters can also be seen in the corridor of W's office building as he enters every morning.</p> <p>The travelator served the modular filming method well; we would film W's character in one costume travelling both ways on the escalator, and upon return to the original end (where our assistant was waiting with the equipment bag) W would change into another costume, and we would loop again. Our other assistant waited at the other end of the escalator to look out for officials. We shot every variant of W\u2019s multi-costumed character in both directions on the escalator.</p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch4/#transition-shots","title":"Transition shots","text":"<p>I needed to devise a means for the characters to pass on the chaotic ending of their story to the gentler beginnings of the other story. The beginning of W's story would focus on an atom spinning, and W\u2019s justification for their work: that \u2018there is so little matter in the universe, it may as well not exist\u2019 (and therefore that reality is but an illusion, and a little more untruth is no different). I found this \u2018fact\u2019 through an IRA-derived process: Googling terms such as \u2018nature of reality\u2019 or \u2018amount of matter in the universe\u2019 until I found websites (of questionable quality) that presented me with information that suited the characters\u2019 motivation. The model \u2018atom\u2019 used in W\u2019s film was a wine cork placed onto the end of an electric drill's screwdriver head. The drill used had a built-in LED light which activated when the drill operated; thus, the drill itself provided both the atoms' spinning and illumination. This scene would be the counterpoint to M's identity breakdown, which would present M repeating a palindromic series of lines as if a spinning kaleidoscope (an effect generated in post-production).</p> <p>The other \u2018transitional\u2019 scene would take advantage of the physical positioning of the screens within the film; using two identical cameras placed on a special rig, I would film the characters' paths crossing in a city. The moment would be an intersection of two paths, as in the title of Calvino's chapter. At the height of W\u2019s breakdown of identity, M would pass in a car, pause as if at traffic lights; M and W would look at each other, and M\u2019s car would continue. This would establish a power relationship between the two characters: M\u2019s travel by executive car would contrast the busy, confused journey by metro we had just witnessed W taking, thus establishing M as a person who is in control. At the same time on-screen an audio cue would direct attention to the other screen: the stereo track, which during W\u2019s film playing forward would be entirely on the left (where W's film is) would transfer to the right (where M\u2019s film is). The shot would require technical logistics and another diagram.</p> Figure 4-45:  The driving route looping around Pont Luis Phillipe which enabled the intersection shot to take place. By the author.

Using a computer screen playing pre-recorded footage of the actors embedded within a model set \u2013 enabled many of the special effects occurred in-camera. Photo by the author. <p>A site was chosen on a bridge in Paris for the live-action transition \u2013\u00a0Pont Louis Philippe.<sup>39</sup> I had lived near to this bridge, at the Cit\u00e9 Internationale des Arts artist studios for 3 months, and had observed the bridge and its footfall near-daily. The one-way bridge is uniquely placed in Paris, as it is adjacent to another, far busier bi-directional bridge (Pont Marie), yet itself has very small vehicular throughput. The high number of one-way streets in Paris were a consistent consideration for film-making. This particular layout, and the relatively quiet nature of the location, meant that between takes the driver could do a loop of the nearby streets to 'reset' the shot each time (see Figure 4-45), as well as ensuring that the actor playing W could safely stand in the middle of the road (supervised by assistant Justine Hermant) between shots.</p> Figure 4-47:  Shooting diagram for the intersection scene of Network / Intersect, as filmed on Pont Luis Phillippe. By the author. <p>The shot was planned via a diagram; the basic premise was that two identical BlackMagic Pocket cameras would be placed next to each other on a rig, so that the right edge of the left camera\u2019s frame would line up with the left edge of the right camera, thus creating an extremely wide-angle shot (the 32:9 ratio with 3880x1080 pixels). W and M would be framed on their relative sides of the screen, save for the time when W crosses the screen into M\u2019s shot. W leaving his own screen was a deliberate choice; I wanted the audience to have a visual cue as to which screen they should divert their attention to. Figure 4-47 shows the actions that had to be performed for this to take place; shooting two films at once, one would have to be reversed. W\u2019s film was the only logical solution, as this shot comes at the end of his film, as part of his confused state (so the rest of the world working the other way round from him makes sense) and M, being composed and in control at the beginning of his film, would have to be moving forwards. The solution was to film W\u2019s end-scene backwards, and M\u2019s introduction scene forwards, both at the same time. Therefore W would walk backwards from right to left of the screen as M\u2019s car approached, then pause and look at M, then walk backwards off-camera to the left as M\u2019s car drove away to the right of the screen. The audience would see the entire scene backwards the first time around, so that W walks up to a car that is reversing up the street, looks at M, and then crosses the road as M reverses out of view, then as both films change direction, W would be walking backwards whilst M moves forwards.<sup>40</sup></p> <p>This day of shooting took a deal of logistical planning: it was the only day that both actors could schedule to work together. I met with M and W, and assistants Justine Hermant (JH) and Justine Emard (JE) at the Palais de Tokyo in the morning. I explained the logistics of each shot that we had to get that day, and we used the Pavillon studio and an unoccupied exhibition space to practise the shots. We then split into two groups: M and I would take an Uber Executive through Paris on the route that enabled us to film his in-car shots. M, JH and JE would follow in another Uber Executive 25 minutes later, and we would all rendezvous at the bridge, where we would shoot the transition scene. M would then leave, and W, the assistants and myself would go to the Cit\u00e9 Internationale des Arts to shoot all of W's corridoor scenes.</p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch4/#audio","title":"Audio","text":"<p>A crucial technique in the signalling of screen the audience should focus on (besides the obvious film direction) would be the audio track. Having two films playing side-by-side in the opposite direction to each other, I wanted a method to ensure the audience knew where to look. Using stereo sound, the audio of the film that is playing forwards is selected to come from that side of the screen, so that when W\u2019s film is playing forwards \u2013\u00a0on the left screen \u2013\u00a0the audio is active in the left channel and silent in the right, and vice versa for M. The transitional scenes, where one storyline transitions into the other, and the direction of both films changes, would feature a cross-fade to signal this change. In the video shown in Korea, subtitles would also act as a visual cue.</p> Figure 4-48:  \u2018Remember: You\u2019re in Korea\u2019 poster on the travelator at Ch\u00e2talet les Halles in Paris as part of shooting. Filming can be seen in the background. Photo by Justine Emard. Figure 4-49:  The author using a modified Canon 6D camera to film actor Hokyoung Im. Photo by Justine Emard. <p>Audio also became a crucial part of the editing process. I always find editing a film sequence to audio far easier than editing without. This film was edited on non-linear editing software Premiere Pro.<sup>41</sup> In the software, it is possible to place visual markers, say, every 4 seconds, which can be used to trim clips as needed. But this does not always aid the pace of film-editing; so I decided to use a click-track equivalent. Using the programming language Processing and sound library Minim, I generated two sine-wave notes (C5 and G5) of 0.5 seconds\u2019 length.<sup>42</sup> These were imported into the timelines of the two films, M and W, in my Premiere Pro timeline so that every second a note would play \u2013\u00a0a G every fourth second, and a C every other second. This meant that I was able to remain conscious of pacing and timing of shots whilst editing. As every cut would fall on a G, it became easy to work out how long shots I was editing would last, and whether they were suitable. It is remarkably hard to edit shots to a particular length without such a click-track. In the final edits of the films, I decided to keep the click-tracks in; their consistency led to a distinctive aesthetic, similar to that found in Nybble, and helped signal the audio cue from one screen to another, and their pacing gave a sense of order. It also proved to be an interesting artefact of the process that had led to the films; an instance of the form being shaped by the content.</p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch4/#visualising-break-down","title":"Visualising break-down","text":"<p>During W's film, the audience witness him creating false stories similar to those that Chen describes: mundane mis-truths about small towns in the American coutryside. I wanted the towns to sound distinctly American and plausible, so downloaded a dataset of small towns in the United States from the US Government's Open Data site.<sup>43</sup> In my trips to the United States over the past few years, I had been struck by the distinctive way in which Americans say town names \u2013 normally, the town's name is closely followed by the state it is in. This seemed like the sort of detail that the IRA would have picked up on. W's dialogue when describing fictional events would be like a news ticker:</p> <p>Swink, Oklahoma. The senator's wife still missing. Temecula, California. A plane crash...</p> <p>However, the town names become more confused:</p> <p>Agora Hills, California. A strange man in a trench coat. Agnosia Hills, California\u2026</p> <p>Agora Hills is immediately followed by Agnosia Hills. Agnosia is a mental symptom whereby the subject fails to recognise or identify objects, often associated with conditions where patients lose their grasp on reality (e.g. Altzheimer's).<sup>44</sup> W's statements become more confused and mundane as the film goes on, eventually culminating in the statement:</p> <p>Seoul, South Korea. A businessman in a car.</p> <p>This signals something he is actually seeing: therefore, the false worlds he creates and the one he lives in are merging. W falls victim to his own trap, believing the untruths he spreads whilst add another layer to his uncertain reality.</p> <p>The short, succinct style for these lines had several influences. One was my memory of news-ticker headlines from old radio programmes when I was a child. Another was Dora Garcia\u2019s book All the Stories, which is a compendium of short stories with many sources, each told in a few sentences;<sup>45</sup> another still was the opening to Bob Dylan's Theme Time Radio Hour programme, which ran from 2006-2009. At the beginning of each episode, a female voice declared a series of short statements in a consistent format:</p> <p>It\u2019s night time in the big city. A truck driver runs a red light. A strange quiet man practices tai chi in a park. It\u2019s Theme Time Radio Hour with your host Bob Dylan.<sup>46</sup></p> <p>The statements were short and intriguing, with just enough detail to paint an intriguing picture of a scene.</p> <p>Another signifier of the chaos in W\u2019s life is his office cubicle: it becomes messier as he becomes more confused. All of the scenes featuring W at his desk were in fact shot with a forced perspective \u2013\u00a0and angled table \u2013\u00a0against a rear-projection screen.<sup>47</sup> This was the same rear-projection set also used for M's office scenes. W's office cubicle was a model built of polystyrene board, built with Justine Emard. With a fixed-position camera, we shot video of the scene becoming messier over time; the carpet gets patchy and stained, post-it notes, documents and maps get stuck onto the wall, and the floor becomes covered in messy paper and rubbish.</p> Figure 4-50:  The contrast between the worldviews of the characters M and W can be seen in the physical spaces they inhabit: W\u2019s (above) is messy and chaotic, whilst M\u2019s (below) is ordered and clean. Photos by the author. <p>The office\u2019s exterior also changes over time. The shots of W walking down the corridor were shot at the Cit\u00e9 Internationale des Arts, and feature the same \u2018Remember: You're in Korea\u2019 posters as the travellator scenes on the metro. The company W works for is called Ray Inversion (a reference to M\u2019s character). Each time M enters the door, the sign is increasingly distorted (reflecting the ever-changing, temporary offices Chen describes and W's mental state):<sup>48</sup> first, the sign is shabbily taped to the door; then taped upside down; then, multiple signs are taped haphazardly on top of each other. The external world again reflects W's current state of mind.</p> <p>Similarly to W\u2019s office, M\u2019s board-room was also a model with a forced perspective. However, the process was slightly different for M: first, footage of M (and myself, as the \u2018client\u2019) was shot on the same set as W\u2019s cubicle (the rear projection screen). The image projected behind M is a blue wallpaper pattern that was \u2018mirrored\u2019 in Photoshop to create a line of symmetry. We shot all of M's scenes, including the scenes featuring me as M, and recorded the dialogue digetically. These scenes were then edited for visual clarity (increasing contrast, eliminating unwanted background, etc.) and the footage transferred to an 27\" iMac with high-resolution screen. The iMac itself was placed into a forced-perspective model of M's boardroom, and each scene re-shot from multiple angles, so that it appeared that M was inhabiting a miniature model.</p> Figure 4-51:  A series of screen-grabs from the film Network / Intersect, with their original subtitles. The film can be seen in its entirity via the supplementary materials provided with this thesis. By the author. <p>The paperwork that M is seen looking at in his office are stylised re-drawings of diagrams taken from an ebook copy of Newton's Opticks.<sup>49</sup> These were printed on top of discarded corporate spreadsheets, salvaged from a bin in Paris. The table under the paper gains the superimposition of Prelinger Archive footage of a giant telescope, further highlighting the visual metaphor.<sup>50</sup> This optical metaphor also spread into the buildings that M inhabits: these were simple models constructed from elements of Flickr images of downtown Seoul (a technique inspired by the IRA). The images were mirrored to echo the central motif of M's story; this image was then put onto a high-resolution TV screen which was placed behind cardboard cut-outs of mirrored buildings taken from other images of buildings in downtown Seoul. These buildings also featured the logo of an eye \u2013\u00a0designed to be one of M\u2019s company logos. The design of this logo was based around Ptolemy's idea that vision occurs via the eye casting out beams of light;<sup>51</sup> the logic being that the protagonist in Calvino\u2019s story begins by paraphrasing Plotnius, and therefore would be likely to have also read early treatise on vision by other Greek philosophers.<sup>52</sup> I did design logos for companies that would serve as a basic visual history of optical theories throughout philosophy, but cut the detail before shooting as it was a concept too complex to explain via the script.</p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch4/#performance-reflecting-propagandist-techniques","title":"Performance reflecting propagandist techniques","text":"<p>The mode of performance for the actors was designed to reflect the IRA techniques. As the IRA workers are given the minimum information required to carry out each task \u2013 often resulting in them sending confused, contradictory messages \u2013\u00a0the actors in this film were deliberately given minimal instructions in order to act in each scene (with the exception of the bridge-transition scene).<sup>53</sup> This was a mode of answering the research question, extending scripting to the process of producing a film, and often led to absurd scenarios.</p> <p>For the break-down of M\u2019s character, I wanted to evoke a feeling of lack of meaning to the words the actor was speaking. This would create a sense of confusion, similar to the confusion the character M was supposed to be feeling at that time (I had thought of his mental state as being like Fregoli delusion, whereby facial recognition and the boundaries between self and others are warped).<sup>54</sup> In order to evoke this state, the actor would be directed to repeat the palindromic script, which also featured numerous optical references (\u2018shift the focus\u2019), until it lost all meaning, getting faster and louder each time. Since I played the \u2018other\u2019 that M merges with, I also underwent this process. After about 2 minutes, I entered a trance-like state of repetition, and the script I had written was unrecognisable. However, this is one area of the film that I do not feel is successful; it is a repeated palindrome within a repeating palindromic film, but the audio recording was low quality.</p> <p>Similarly, whilst shooting W as his multitude of characters, a \u2018modular\u2019 approach was taken. This involved a rotating array of rear-projected backgrounds (the disintegrating office scenes), a repeated set of instructions, and a series of costume changes. The idea was to get footage of every permutation of W's character, against every possible background, behaving in one of four manners (staring vacantly at the camera, typing, typing manically and \u2018freestyle\u2019), so that this footage could be interspersed later on in the editing process. Shooting these scenes took around 4 hours, during which time the actor repeated the same behaviours hundreds of times. It became a strange, ritualistic performance, and, like shooting M\u2019s character, during shooting the ritual overtook any sense of meaning.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Felix Barrett and Maxine Doyle, The Drowned Man: A Hollywood Fable, Play (Temple Studios, 31 London St, London W2 1DJ, United Kingdom: Punchdrunk and the National Theatre, 2013).\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>G.

The presentation of projects in this order displays both a thematic, and roughly chronological progression in my design research work over the past few years.</p> <p>Chapter one discussed behavioural scripting within two already-initiated projects, the Godot Machine and Ant Ballet. Using Bateson\u2019s concept of psychological framing (which shares a number of concepts with both Schank and Abelson, and Tomkins\u2019 script theories), the chapter discussed the framing of both of these projects in relation to the field of \u2018sci-art\u2019. It concluded that my practice is best defined as work that is informed, but not defined, by an engagement with other disciplines, including science.</p> <p>Chapter two introduced two projects, Nybble and Scriptych, which employed performative diagrams of computational processes, and were shown in major cultural institutions. Both projects used absurd diagrams as means of understanding, rather than purely explicating, concepts related to computation. Scripts were exploited in each piece as a mode of giving instruction to performers, whilst Scriptych made heavy use of computational scripting in both its creation and performance, which lead to the development of a novel method for interacting with a detailed three-dimensional vector database.</p> <p>Chapter three focused on computational scripting, using a pair of projects (86400 and 24fps Psycho) as a mode of critiquing specific contemporary technologies. The computationally-generated film 86400 employed a script to interact with the Google Image Search API, creating a database of hundreds of thousands of time-related images, which were compiled into a 24-hour-long film: the work was a diagram seeking to create an immersive critique of the endless onslaught of classification that is pervasive in digital culture, and in turn to highlight its meaninglessness. 24fps Psycho used computational scripting, and a diagrammatic computer interface\u00a0(Max) to create an ultimately unsuccessful film that was performed live in front of an audience. The chapter discussed the various reasons for this projects\u2019 failures, and speculated that such a project will likely appear computationally na\u00efve as future technologies develop which render the machine learning tasks attempted easy.</p> <p>Finally, chapter four introduced the creation of the film Network / Intersect via a methodology entitled reflexive scripted design, an original process in which the designer takes full authorial control over a project, designing a set of constraining rules, then producing work by following those rules. Although the process has a major impact on the formal outcome of the project, it is not currently a form-finding exercise in the sense that many parametric design techniques are. Building on the techniques of Italo Calvino and the Oulipo movement, the designer places extreme constraints of their own making onto a project, whilst also rooting it in time and history. Reflexive scripted design has been tested once, on the creation of Network/Intersect; its robustness and use beyond this exercise require further study.</p> <p>The main argument of the thesis is that the notion of script is one that is both important, and underexplored, in architectural design discourse. The word script is tied to early notions of writing as well as drawing, and is in regular use within theatrical and filmic productions, psychology and computer programming. Within architectural design, however, script is most commonly used in relation to computer scripts, and, by extension, parametric design. This thesis has argued that this narrow understanding of script belies a rich vein of concepts that exhibit potential for new design methodologies, such as reflexive scripted design, which I outlined and tested in chapter 4. This wider understanding of script allows for an architectural discourse that includes conversations about authorship, freedom, and creativity within design.</p> <p>I have also presented the Camusian \u2018absurd<sub>b</sub>\u2019 as a mode of critique, arguing that the themes contained within the plays of the Theatre of the Absurd \u2013\u00a0originally written in Europe at the beginning of the Cold War \u2013 are in fact relevant to present-day uses of technology. The method used to implement this critique has been through the construction of projects which function as absurd diagrams, or absurd machines. The synthesis of these central themes \u2013 scripting, the absurd<sub>b</sub>, and diagrammatic practice \u2013 and the mode in which they have been explored (through active design research) represents a novel enquiry.</p> <p>The thesis has presented a diverse set of design projects, using different media and methodologies. However, these projects have several points of convergence. Firstly, there are clear thematic links between the projects: each work has displayed a clear trajectory in its development of the notions of script, the absurd, diagram, and computational technology, with each project seeking to pose specific questions which enable an audience to create their own absurd<sub>b</sub> realisation. Secondly, all the projects employ a kind of \u2018script\u2019 as a mode of expressing design intent, from the use of computer scripts in 86400, 24fps Psycho and Scriptych; to performance scripts and instructions in Nybble, Scriptych and Network/Intersect; and the use of a reflexive scripted design process in Network / Intersect. These works developed from my preliminary concerns with the scripting animal behaviour in the Godot Machine and Ant Ballet. The process of translating a script into an artefact, performance, film, or whatever else it may become, is for me the most interesting part of my design practice. It is where the nuances of the mode of scripting are most accentuated, and where the freedoms or restrictions inherent within each kind of script are most concisely articulated. It has been a great privilege to have such a high degree of authorial control over the translation of these projects from script to \u2018thing\u2019; many of the characters discussed in the introduction of the thesis (including Ptolemy, Alberti, and even Beckett) now have no control over the way their scripts are translated and implemented.<sup>1</sup> This section of the thesis examines some of the peculiarities and differences between the various modes of scripting, and the translation of these scripts into artefacts, films, and performances.</p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch5/#reflections-on-practice","title":"Reflections on Practice","text":"<p>It is worth noting that none of these projects was developed in isolation from each other: most of the work was carried out in the same studio spaces, using the same computer, with often overlapping production timescales.<sup>2</sup> Yet each mode of scripting carried its own set of parameters, requiring different modes of engagement with subject matter, spaces within studios, and even other people. Practicing the various modes of scripting simultaneously often required jumping from one state of mind to another, in order to pursue contrasting logics and practices, for example, the shift from computational scripting to writing an actual film script. Sometimes I would need to find means to transfer from one mode of scripting to another; often this was in the form of a walk, a meal, or exercise. Some environments were far better suited to different modes of scripting: the isolated studio apartment where I lived in Paris was far better for writing computer code than the sociable studio in the Palais de Tokyo, yet the latter was far better for visual inspiration, creative thinking, and sharing ideas. Understanding the requirements of each mode of scripting informed the way in which work was produced. This is of particular importance today, as computational scripting becomes both and more popular, and more accessible, in architectural design.</p> <p>The computational aspects of the works mentioned in chapters 2 and 3 required the adoption of a completely different creative mindset to other parts of the projects. In the second chapter, I have outlined the way in which I attempted to think through the logic of computational code and create instructions, which would effectively generate the desired performance from a computer. Much of this code-writing made use of external libraries (as described by Ousterhout), which meant that lower-level functions could be achieved with rudimentary knowledge of the underlying principles.<sup>3</sup> The machine-learning scripts used to train the word-vectors in Scriptych, for example, were based on a library called Gensim by Radim \u0158eh\u016f\u0159ek, which enabled the parsing of large corpora of words to create word-vectors for every word which appeared in a collection of Hollywood film scripts, themselves having been downloaded via automated scripts and processed by Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil at Cornell University.<sup>4</sup> Gensim is open-source, and is maintained by \u0158eh\u016f\u0159ek and myriad other volunteers; it was programmed in Python, itself an open-source programming framework with thousands of contributors, and it makes extensive use of Tomas Mikolov et al\u2019s Word2Vec process.<sup>5</sup> The interface that enabled dancers\u2019 moves to retrieve these words was built in Max, a visual scripting language, but also made extensive use of libraries which enabled it to communicate with the sensors via Open Sound Control, as well as an instance of Gensim running in Python, and the \u2018say\u2019 functions within Mac OS X\u2019s built-in command line interface. I could continue to cite various libraries, snippets of code, dependencies, interfaces, and languages for each project (including several more for Scriptych), but this thesis is about design research, not computer science. In short, using computer scripting languages enables the integration of myriad external libraries which extend the core functionality of a language, making repetitive or difficult tasks easier, or simply speeding up the production process (as described by Ousterhout).<sup>6</sup></p> <p>Although many of the libraries for languages such as Python are open-source, and freely distributed, there is a cost to the ease with which they can be used. This is borne in both ignorance over functionality, whereby the end user does not have to know what the computer is really doing when a certain instance is called, and the risk of creating software that is overly dependent on external libraries. Many libraries are in fact reliant on other, lower-level libraries for their core functionality; a library such as pyMovie is actually a fancy wrapper for ffmpeg, for example. Simultaneously, the high level of dependency that operates within these languages can act as an Achilles' heel: the deprecation of Google's Image Search API during the execution of 86400's image-gathering procedure highlighted how the lack of support for one particular library, API, or even language can have a major impact on the reliability of an artwork. Even the software which ran Scriptych, developed only last year, requires a very specific software and hardware setup, and is at risk of not working simply through routine software updates on the smartphones or laptop it runs on (the computer used to produce the work, and this thesis, has auto-updated its operating system tens of times since then). This is partly due to the low-budget nature of such software development: experimental projects such as this one are a form of electronic bricolage, relying on off-the-shelf hardware and software patched together via untested means. Whilst other artefacts \u2013\u00a0films, buildings, costumes, books, etc \u2013\u00a0are all at risk of various forms of degradation, none quite match the fragility of this type of computer-based work of art.<sup>7</sup> Attempts to rectify these vulnerabilities and archive software tend to focus on the concept of a virtual machine, a software emulation of specific hardware and operating systems, a necessity which generally prohibits physical archiving and interaction.<sup>8</sup> The remedy to such issues might be a step towards more robust, lower-level programming on my behalf\u2013\u00a0but this takes considerable time and effort to learn, and, as I will explain shortly, such practice comes at a cost.</p> <p>Writing computer code, in my experience, requires a different mode of engagement to other modes of design practice. Whereas physical design, with pencil and paper, can be completed in a loud studio (perhaps with music playing), in a conversational manner, the writing of code of any complexity often requires its author to engage in intense concentration as they iteratively build layers of complexity into an extremely abstract system. In my experience, this is also intensely antisocial, and my physical studio requirements differ if I am building a model for a film, or writing a programme, which interfaces with an online service. Often I have found myself the only person in any given place working on a code-based project (as was the case in Opera Garnier with Scriptych, or whilst working in Nanji in Seoul on 24fps Psycho). This creates a different atmosphere to the traditional design studio, a place which relies on a high level of interaction between its inhabitants in order to enable the cross-pollination of ideas. Where I have found traditional design logic is best explored through testing it with other people \u2013 both as design ideas are formed and often fleshed out in a convivial manner, and asking the opinion of colleagues (or anyone else) \u2013\u00a0often my code is written in isolation, and the support communities exist purely online, in the form of websites, wikis, and forums.</p> <p>Much of my non-code design practice contains references to other work (for example, the repeated references to Stanley Kubrick\u2019s films in the Godot Machine and Ant Ballet, or to Beckett in Nybble), or a moment of humour (for example, the posters reminding the viewer they are \u2018in Korea\u2019 in Network / Intersect). I try to maintain this ethos whilst writing code, embedding humour or references into the very functionality of the project.<sup>9</sup> I am aware that in most cases this will never be seen: the work I produce is generally too embedded in artistic practice to be of interest to many programmers, and that sort of detail is too technical to be of interest to most of my peers in the design, art, or architecture worlds.<sup>10</sup></p> <p>Computer programmers and scripters alike often refer to a state of working they call \u2018flow\u2019 \u2013\u00a0a total immersion in work whereby everything outside of the task in hand becomes unimportant and abstract.<sup>11</sup> I have experienced this state whilst working on numerous design projects, but never to the same extent as whilst working with computer scripting. There is something about working on extremely technical issues, which requires a thought process quite different from normal, everyday logic. This causes me to lose myself in my work, which I find immensely enjoyable.<sup>12</sup> Similarly, the highly technical nature of computer scripting has a draw for a particular type of person within the field of architecture. As Peg Rawes notes, although there is a near-even ratio of female to male students within US/UK architecture schools, code-based architectural design (such as parametricism) is: \u2018more commonly populated by male students who are instructed through intensive workshops which focus on repetition and emulation.\u2019<sup>13</sup> Whilst this is problematic within the world of architecture, it is perhaps manifest most explicitly in the remarkably male-dominated workplaces of Silicon Valley. As recent news reports have shown, there is increasing discontent with the aggressive corporate culture perpetuated within Silicon Valley technology companies (in particular Uber).<sup>14</sup> Chapter 3 of this thesis discussed one instance where the idealised, quasi-mathematical model of continual movement has been translated into a daily reality for a swathe of Uber\u2019s drivers, who are now the test-subjects in what the company is calling the Perpetual Trip.<sup>15</sup> Much of the aggressive nature of the technology industry is arguably perpetuated by the mythology surrounding the Valley\u2019s start-up scene: the image of young (usually male) entrepreneurs frantically building circuit boards, writing code, and using venture capital to create the \u201cnext big thing\u201d in a garage is synonymous with Silicon Valley\u2019s corporate technological culture.<sup>16</sup></p> <p>The notion of a mythological origin story is not only found in Silicon Valley technologists. As was mentioned in the introduction, Rawes has argued that the \u2018hot house\u2019 methods in which parametricism is taught within universities, small teams, and \u2018labs\u2019 has generated a discourse around the style that relinquishes designer agency and equates computation-based design with \u2018natural\u2019 processes.<sup>17</sup> Rawes claims that latter is reinforced by mythologised connections between code and highly selective slices of genetic theory (such as D\u2019Arcy Wentworth Thompson\u2019s On Growth and Form) drawing parallels between parametricism and organic, nonhuman processes.<sup>18</sup> As a result, this \u2018uncritical belief in computational emergence\u2019 Rawes argues, \u2018reduces diverse organic life to a self-same matter\u2019.<sup>19</sup> This argument has parallels with Korzbyski\u2019s map-territory relation (as invoked by Bateson), discussed in chapter 1:<sup>20</sup> claiming that an organic system can be explained through a mathematical model (as is the case with many of the morphological arguments in On Growth and Form) is akin to producing a map of a territory; it necessarily requires a process of reduction and exclusion. Using that same map, or parametric model, to then plan territory renders the territory itself subject to the same process of reduction and exclusion. In the case of parametricism, human behaviour and desires are often reduced to a simple agent-based model, which reduces human desire to the status of movement through space.<sup>21</sup> Rawes proposes a renewed interest in Spinoza\u2019s notion of geometric and ecological ratios as a means of ensuring human wellbeing and environmental responsibility; I will shortly discuss how I believe Tomkins\u2019 notion of psychological scripting may also offer a means of a more humane mode of architectural practice. Computational scripting does not have to exist in isolation, or as a non-critical discipline within architectural design. The projects presented in this thesis show the ability to use computational scripting to pose critical questions about contemporary technology, as also demonstrated by artists such as James Bridle, Kasia Molga, Heath Bunting, and institutions such as Het Nieuwe Instituut in the Netherlands.</p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch5/#performative-scripting","title":"Performative Scripting","text":"<p>In contrast to the technical nature of computer scripting, the performative scripts I have written in the course of this thesis were created under a wide variety of circumstances. The production of Nybble was the first time I had coordinated and directed dancers; while the making of Network/Intersect was the first time I had worked with actors and film crew who required direction (in the making of the earlier Ant Ballet film, I had been simultaneously the actor and director, technician and experimenter). The process of developing instructions to be given to dancers or actors verbally along with the written scripts themselves was an entirely new concept to me when I began these projects. As the designer of performances, I find it easy to focus on the spectacle of the overall piece, or the technical details, and forget the emotional experience of the performers who will be enacting the work. With Nybble, I was fortunate to be able to bring in my frequent collaborator Abi Palmer to coach and instruct dancers in their movements. During the conception of the piece, I had failed to think about what the dancers would be thinking as they were dancing, and how their thoughts and mental states are translated into the movements the audience sees. Abi developed a language of instruction as a supplement to the technical information I had already provided the dancers with. Her commands asked the performers to imagine they were in some other state, such as being underwater, on fire, made of various substances, to move slow, fast, etc, in order to animate their gestures. This generated an ensemble, which was imminently more engaging to the audience as well as the dancers, who were no longer simply performing rote movements to get into a particular position.</p> <p>I was later informed by dancers at the Paris Opera that this approach is a common technique adopted by performers to help them memorise routines. Whilst working with choreographer Simon Valastro, and developing a highly technical interface for the dancers to work with, I saw these mnemonic techniques in practice \u2013 even for the highly precise gestures required by the software I had created. Movements gained nicknames such as \u2018Virgin Mary\u2019 (a praying position), \u2018handshake\u2019, \u2018mother and child\u2019 or \u2018reset\u2019, to render them memorable in sequence, and to imbue them with emotion which the dancer could then express through movement. In the case of Nybble and Scriptych, the dancers\u2019 approach to learning and expression was thus not entirely cohesive with the mode of interpretation required for the software or code; for both pieces I had hoped the dancers would treat the choreography like instructions in a manual, but human scripting proved to be far less binary than its computational equivalent.</p> <p>The live aspect of these performances further highlighted the difficulty in synthesising human and computational agents. The performances of Scriptych, for example, felt very much like a technical presentation, and tension was heightened by the aforementioned vulnerability of software and hardware interfaces, made quickly and using experimental and even bricolage-style means. The first time the female dancer moved, and the system was tested in front of a live audience, was a tense moment for Simon and I, who were watching the performance from above in a control booth-like position. Both of us had highly technical jobs to do at the time, using the custom interfaces of smartphones and tablets to cue certain parts of the performance (I was monitoring the input from the dancers\u2019 phones whilst Simon was responsible for changing the section of the music, which also controlled the way in which the programme \u2018listened\u2019 for movements). This is a position I have often myself during performances of this kind, including 24fps Psycho, Scriptych, Ant Ballet, and the numerous technical demonstrations I have given throughout and beyond this doctoral research. I have heard numerous stories from colleagues who work with similar technology, as well as directly experiencing, the horror of presenting a technical mechanism or software interface or similar to a room full of people, only to have it fail to do what it was meant to do (and in most cases, had been doing only moments before). The tension this feeling invokes was amplified during the performance of Scriptych, as the failure of the software would not solely affect me, but also leave the dancers performing for nine minutes in front of an audience, unguided. This vulnerability also placed strain on the reputation of the choreographer, the curators, and the institutions we were collectively representing. It was, in short, the biggest risk I had every undertaken with a project, but also now feels like one of the most rewarding. Having scrutinised the video recordings of the two performances and the practice sessions, the tension the dancers were carrying in the performance is palpable. Yet I believe this human element actually improves the film, adding tension where the computational script cannot.</p> <p>The translation of emotions to performance was also present in the making of Network / Intersect. As I had not worked with actors before, I encountered several unanticipated issues in the translation of the written and diagrammed script to actual performance. One shot in particular, where the executive character silently descends a marble staircase, took around fifteen takes. This was partly due to my inexperienced direction: I had a particular style of movement in mind for the actor to use in the descent, which seemed of utmost importance when filming, but found the viscerality of human movement hard to verbalise. Ultimately, the shot used in the film was the product of a series of negotiations and minor tests. The way in which both of the actors embodied their characters was interesting to see; one of the actors would continually play in their role, testing new movements, facial expressions and characteristics, whilst the other preferred to have a more grounded, rationalised explanation of exactly how their momentary performance would fit into the characters\u2019 trajectory. Similarly, it was a revelation to find that the small crew I was working with often only needed to know what their immediate task was, rather than an in-depth knowledge of how a shot fitted into the wider context of the film. This aided the experimental style of the films\u2019 shooting, in which the cast and crew were tasked with small, repetitive, and iterative tasks, much like the Russian propaganda workers they were unwittingly mimicking.</p> <p>The physical locations in which I wrote scripts varied immensely across the performance pieces. The logic behind Nybble (and the coding of the Microsoft Excel sheet which was ultimately used to sequence the performance) was aided by a series of conversations with collaborators, as well as colleagues. This is a mode of design I am familiar with: conversation and free-floating ideas from myriad sources gradually find their way towards a convergent and cohesive narrative, which can be expressed in some sort of design medium. A similar process was true of the writing of Scriptych: I wrote the palindromic dialogue between the dancers overnight after an intense period of ideas-generation with Simon Valastro close to our first collaborative meeting. With minor changes, this dialogue remained the central part of the performance; most other elements, including most of the computer programming logic, and even the variety of movements available for Simon to create choreography with, came through systematic and iterative developments made after thorough testing of the system. Of all the modes of computer scripting explored in this thesis, this particular one, whereby Simon and I would meet daily for several hours and identify issues, which I would then work on alone through the afternoon and evening to solve, was by far the most satisfying. Consistent and near-immediate feedback on a design proposal, particularly one that interacts with someone whose working methods I find challenging to empathise with (I am by no means a gifted dancer) was highly enjoyable. The process felt like a conversation whereby we each came to understand the others\u2019 perspectives, mediated by a common interest in the development of a performance. Numerous aspects of the performance and interface were a direct result of this closely integrated design-testing process. This is precisely the type of empathetic thought process, whereby one has to shift one\u2019s perspective into the place of another human (rather than machine), which is almost impossible working exclusively in computer script (as opposed to any other design medium). I will be looking to pursue projects where technology requires collaborative and empathetic design and feedback cycles in the future.</p> <p>The scripting process for Network / Intersect contrasts the scripting experiences of projects such as 86400 and 24fps Psycho. Where both of the more technical projects required dedicated days of computer scripting, largely in isolation from external forces, Network / Intersect was largely conceived and written in the most clich\u00e9d way possible: by wandering the streets of Paris with a notebook in hand. The reflexive scripted process was the result of countless late-night walks through the city, as well as conversations with colleagues, friends and strangers alike. The experience of writing a work of fiction \u2013 the first I have attempted \u2013 was immensely pleasurable, although the synthesis of the myriad ideas which fed into the project took a long time. The process of creating rules in order to construct the script was part in due to the frustration at connecting the concepts I wanted to integrate into the project itself; I forced myself to work within extreme constraints to reduce the number of possibilities that existed. The disconnection between the dialogue and on-screen action was a deliberate choice that was made upon realising that the film required around 65 shots to be filmed in a 3-week span; synchronising dialogue and cutting film to match the project\u2019s rigid time structure would be highly challenging; the film would be far easier to cut if the dialogue could be treated separately. This inadvertently aided the film itself: a dialogue over the top of the film caused the pair of films to appear to be a reflection of the internal states of the characters themselves, channelling the Batesonian notion that \u2018human beings operate more easily in a universe where some of their psychological characteristics are externalised.\u2019<sup>22</sup></p>"},{"location":"1_Chapters/ch5/#future-research","title":"Future research","text":"<p>This study has examined several key areas related to script, the absurd, diagrams and performance from the perspective of a designer and artist working in performative architectural design and film-making. This is, by virtue of the research methodology, a limiting practice. No one person can reasonably expect to tackle all issues that they might wish to. Whilst this thesis has provided accounts of my own research-based methodology, there are several areas, which I have not yet been able to explore which I believe may yield fruitful research in the future.</p> <p>The first is the relationship between psychological scripting, affect, and architecture, with the theories of Sillvan Tomkins of particular interest. To what extent can architecture influence the way in which Tomkinsian scripts form, develop and are enacted; and what could this tell us about how to improve design for human inhabitation? Whilst behavioural scripting is a term already in use within parametricist discourse, it generally refers to programming highly reductive \u2018agents\u2019 in a virtual environment to simulate their movement (rather than emotions), most commonly whilst in a crowd. A study into Tomkinsian psychological scripting and affect may yield interesting methods for designing better, more humane environments, which are enjoyable to inhabit.<sup>23</sup> One possible case study (which I mentioned briefly in the footnotes to the introduction chapter) could be Hogeweyk in the Netherlands, a care community for dementia sufferers (designed by Dementia Village Architects: Frank van Dillen and Michael Bol).<sup>24</sup> The community is designed to have the appearance of a generic town, with amenities such as shop, theatre, pub, and public square, with residents carrying out apparently normal lives within the town. It is, in effect, a safe place, offering residents a good deal more autonomy than residents than a traditional care home. One of the significant problems that dementia suffers commonly face is the confrontation with the realisation that they are being looked after, and mistrust that occurs when, for example, staff who they do not recognise have to coerce them into taking medication. Hogeweyk operates to a different principle: staff do not wear uniforms, but rather clothes that imply they are just ordinary citizens in the town; the residents are able to go about their lives in a manner whereby they can continue what might be described as scripted behaviour, buying groceries at the shop, visiting the pub or restaurant, all the while being cared for by the staff (who find themselves playing generic \u2018roles\u2019). The carers do not contradict the reality the residents project onto their situation unless explicitly asked; thus, the residents are able to be cared for in a way that minimises conflict, and associated stress and mistrust.<sup>25</sup></p> <p>The second area for future research is the viability of the reflexive scripted design process, both for its current intended media of fictional film and theatre, as well as for other modes of design. So far, I have made one film using this practice, but its robust viability is unproved in any medium beyond this. How might reflextive scripted design be applied to other modes of practice, such as design of the built environment or graphics? Is it only suitable for work that deals with fiction? These, and more questions, are as yet unanswered.</p> <p>The final area of research that I believe to be interesting is precisely the one I intend to work on next: better defining the relationship between the psychological script, human agency, and various models of freedom. As explained in this thesis\u2019 introduction, human agency, and the extent to which behaviour can be codified and predicted, is one of the central questions of large-scale surveillance systems \u2013 themselves often operated by \u2018agencies\u2019 of the state. These immense prediction systems, also the product of myriad machine learning computer scripts, rely on inferences about human behaviour based on the \u2018logic of resemblance.\u2019<sup>26</sup> The systems are constructed on the assumption that with enough data, patterns of threatening or subversive behaviour will reveal themselves through a similarity to previous instances of such behaviour \u2013 i.e. that such behaviour is, itself, somehow subject to a script. The relationship between this mode of behavioural analysis with the intention of prediction, as well as the often opaque mechanisms through which it often operates, and the concepts of psychological scripting advocated by Tomkins / Schank and Abelson, is largely unexplored. What\u2019s more, the evolving nature of the predictive systems, and the way in which they codify and predict human behaviour contain potential implications for the three types of freedom \u2013 personal, sovereign, and civic freedom \u2013\u00a0identified by historical sociologist Orlando Patterson.<sup>27</sup> This is a subject area which I have hinted at but not explicitly explored, throughout this thesis, one in which I believe the topic of the absurd<sub>b</sub> may one again prove to be a useful ally.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Two examples of people mentioned in this thesis who have been unhappy with the interpretation of their scripts: Stanley Kubrick\u2019s adaptation of Stephen King\u2019s novel The Shining left the author so dissatisfied that he made his own version for television in 1997 (seventeen years after the release of Kubrick\u2019s film), and Charlie Kaufman, who has discussed his dissatisfaction with George Clooney\u2019s direction of his screenplay Confessions of a Dangerous Mind in numerous interviews.

Architecture in 2009 to undertake a Masters in Architectural Design, as part of the Interactive Architecture Workshop led by Stephen Gage.<sup>1</sup> The Bartlett provided a fertile test bed for ideas and experiments, and it was here that I learnt to write computational code, as well as integrate advanced manufacturing techniques and prototypical electronics into my production process. Both of these practices had a significant effect on the way that I worked; the possibilities of designing and manufacturing 3D-printed and waterjet-cut components, the use of Arduino microcontrollers and electronic components, and a network of peers and tutors with expertise, led to a phase of intense experimentation in building mechanisms and robotic assemblages. At the same time as developing these practical skills, the conversations with tutors and peers served to develop a number of enlivening ideas, many of which have persisted and found their way into this thesis. The two projects which formed the basis of my Masters in Architectural Design portfolio established a mode of working which continues throughout the other projects in this thesis: namely, the use of diagrammatic techniques to explore, explain, and analogise. I continued to develop both projects during the first year of this doctoral research; however, it is the later re-framing of these projects which had the biggest impact on later work.</p> <ol> <li> <p>See Stephen Gage, \u2018The Bartlett Interactive Architecture Workshop\u2019 (Maverick Machines: An Exhibition Inspired by the Work of Gordon Pask, July 2007).

The basic premise of the software that drove the machine remained constant throughout: a feedback-and-correction system based on visual input from a camera about an ant\u2019s position. However, the design of the object itself went through an iterative process that borrowed a numbering system from the world of software development. Starting at version v0.0,<sup>1</sup> each minor revision (for example, an undated actuator mechanism) would increment the design by v0.1. A major overhaul of the design (for example, a change to the structure itself) would result in a progression to the next integer, so that a major change to machine v0.4 would result in machine v1.0. This system was used to keep track of the many incremental changes and prototypical parts that were built and tested across a small number of underlying structures. The final machine that was built in this method was v3.2.</p> <p>The first model (v0.0-0.1) was a rapidly-made prototype based on some sketches. Its function was to explore the mechanics of driving a polystyrene ball of approximately 180mm in any direction, and it was made of off-cuts, spare parts and old continuous rotation servos that were in the studio. Both models (the first relying on steel rollers, and the second using paper cups to rotate the ball) were unsuccessful in rotating the ball along more than one plane simultaneously, and suffered from unpredictable \u2018drag\u2019 issues caused by friction by the inactive drive wheel. It was clear that a more advanced method was required to progress.</p> <p>The second model, v1.0-1.2, consisted of a concrete base of approximately 150 x 150 x 250mm, with four pressed steel arms of 1000mm length (850mm visible) emerging at an angle of around 25\u00ba from vertical, to be placed on a table or plinth. Each rod had a large surface-mount ball bearing bolted approximately two thirds of the way up, and at the extreme end, the actuating device. Resting atop the four ball bearings was a white polystyrene ball of 500mm diameter. I experimented variously with regular wheels (v1.0) and \u2018omniwheels\u2019<sup>2</sup> (v1.1) attached to continuous rotation servos, and finally with a \u2018finger\u2019 mechanism (v1.2): a pair of lightweight micro-servos, configured to pan and tilt a small metal rod which would push the ball to rotate it. My electronics skills at this stage were still crude, and the micro-servos were incredibly jittery and ineffective at actually rotating the ball (and far better at gouging it). When I presented the work at a first critique, rather than criticise my shoddy electronics and manufacture, the panel complimented the paranoid personality the machine appeared to have. I decided to try and keep a non-wheel-based rotation with the next iteration.</p> <p>I then built a more precise experimental base for the machine using laser-cut aluminium (v2.0), also designed to be placed on a table or plinth.<sup>3</sup> Still using four ball bearings to support the 500mm ball, the chassis was designed with experimentation in mind. Each of the armatures which supported the rotation mechanisms had rows of pre-cut holes to accommodate fixing of new mechanisms at different angles. The first two mechanisms to be tested on the machine were categorically failures: laser-cut (v2.0) or 3D-printed (v2.1) \u2018grippers\u2019, powered by servos, would lift the ball from underneath and rotate it in one of four directions. The laser-cut components of v2.1 were too heavy to work with the servos, and the 3D-printed components had too much friction to work reliably. v2.1 marked the first use of 3D printing in my design work.<sup>4</sup> v2.2 then used 3d-printed omniwheels to support the ball (designed to match the profile of the ball itself, unlike the omniwheels of v1.x). However, the omniwheels did not offer enough grip on the 500mm polystyrene ball to actually rotate it. v2.3 returned to the idea of v1.3\u2019s \u2018fingers\u2019, but this time with laser-cut acrylic and padded rubber end-caps. However, none of the mechanisms of v2.x worked effectively. It was at this stage that I realised designing an elegant mechanism to rotate a lightweight polystyrene ball accurately in multiple planes simultaneously was a real engineering challenge. There are multiple pure robotics projects for robots that balance atop balls, etc, but most of these are concerned with the robotics element and pay little heed to the idea of a featureless ball, which I deemed essential to the Godot Machine. If the ball\u2019s surface contained features, then the ant on the ball would have \u2018landmarks\u2019 which it could use to navigate. I spent some time working on rendering polystyrene balls with plaster to create perfect surfaces, but in the end did not find a satisfactory or repeatable method which guaranteed uniform surface, or enabled me to actually transport the balls<sup>5</sup>. I decided that a rethink of the entire system was necessary.</p> Figure 7-52:  An early prototype of the Godot Machine. Photo by the author. <p>This iteration also marked the first design of the \u2018halo\u2019 device, an illuminated ring of white LED lights surrounding a centrally-placed webcam which connects to the controlling computer (and thus the driving devices). v2.x\u2019s light ring was suspended above the ball from an independent support structure, much like an office desk lamp. The halo design itself served both practical and aesthetic functions: in the first instance, it provided an omnidirectional light that would illuminate the ball in order to regulate the light on the ant (much like a ring flash is often used for portrait photography). Secondly, it would confuse the ant: given that the machine was being designed in the UK, the most likely type of ant to be placed on the device would be Lasius niger, the common garden ant. This species is known to use an approximately equal, complementary combination of pheromone trails and visual landmarks to navigate,<sup>6</sup> however, the use of trail pheromones is largely used to signal when an ant has found food, an instance that would not be applicable to an ant on the Godot Machine. A consistent light, bright, circular light source above the ant, which appears to stay in the same place, would hopefully \u2018de-anchor\u2019 any visual cues for the ant. The third function of the light was a small homage to the light ring in Dr. Strangelove.<sup>7</sup></p> Figure 7-53:  The Godot Machine v3.1 with experimental ball surface and drive wheels. This material combination was ultimately unsucessful. Photo by the author. <p>v3.x represented a major change in the machine, and my logic in designing it. Instead of separating the role of support (previously provided by ball-bearings) and actuation (the one factor I had changed so far), this version of the device rested the ball on three drive-shafts. Using three points of support instead of four \u2013 the minimum, and most stable number to support a sphere \u2013 the device was made of three pieces of identical laser-cut steel of 2mm thickness. The steel was then bent along pre-perforated lines and bolted together with M5 bolts. The pieces of bent steel overlapped each other like a camera\u2019s aperture ring, and were in constant tension. Three stepper motors then mounted to the steel frame, and from these, brass rods would provide support to the ball. All experimentation on this model would then be with materials for the ball and the supporting rods. I bought balls with as many surface materials as possible from a nearby sports shop, and began to test these combinations. Since I had not designed the various balls, they did not factor into my numbering system.</p> <p>This chassis proved far more successful as a test-bed. It was also far more efficient in terms of the amount of material it required: v2.x had five different types of aluminium parts, and ten individual aluminium pieces to fit together (excluding mechanisms), whereas v3.x only had three identical steel parts. Whilst it could be tested reliably on a table-top, the design could also be suspended from a ceiling, creating the illusion that the ant really was on top of her own world, a void in space. The stepper motors were easier to programme<sup>8</sup> than the various servo mechanisms that I had been working with. Instead of sequential loops to synchronise their movement, the steppers could be simply required a speed and a direction, and were highly accurate in their rotation. The size of the ball was reduced to between 180-250mm (depending on the type of ball being tested).</p> Figure 7-54:  Plan view engineering diagram of sphere rotation on the Godot Machine v3.x.

Note that 0\u2000 and 180\u2000 represent absolute inversions of motor directions. See Figure 7-54 for diagram. <p>At the same time as building the v3.x chassis, I built a housing for the control system. This served both practical and aesthetic purposes. Due to the practicalities of building a machine without a fixed studio space in an architecture school, and the regular transportation of the device to and from critiques, the machine and associated electronic components were subject to constant movement and dislodging. This would often have an adverse effect on the wiring, which, in prototypical form, was not permanently soldered in place. Due to my inexperience with electronics, I also kept accidentally burning stepper motor driver boards. I decided to build a housing that would enable easy diagnosis of wiring errors or broken parts, and to replace burnt boards within a few minutes. I based the distributed layout of the components on the design of HAL\u2019s, the computer control system in Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 2001: A Space Odyssey.<sup>9</sup> Towards the end of the film, there is a scene where HAL is switched off one component at a time. The individual circuits are laid out sequentially, so that the logic that they control can be easily seen. My panel design for the Godot Machine used a similar logic: it laid out, in diagrammatic form, the process within the microcontroller. A USB cable carries signal from a computer to an Arduino microcontroller at the top-right. This then sends signals to three EasyDriver 4.3 stepper motor drivers, which in turn are connected via long cables to the stepper motors themselves. Along the way are a series of LED indicator lights: one on the Arduino, and one on each stepper driver indicates that it is receiving power. A pair of LEDs on the Arduino signal what it is doing at that moment: a red light indicates that the Arduino is connected to the computer, but not doing anything (\u2018thinking\u2019 mode) whilst a green light indicates that the Arduino is actively sending signal to the stepper motors. The entire electronics layout is housed behind a dark blue Perspex panel with labels to indicate the components underneath, in a similar style to HAL\u2019s fascia. Although relatively simple, the panel represents another level of diagramming within the machine.</p> <p>The final design I was able to build was able to successfully rotate a sphere to any angle. v3.2 used an oversized tennis ball of diameter 180mm for the main sphere, rotated by three polypropylene attachements to the driveshafts of the stepper motors. This material combination had the right amount of friction to enable the main ball to turn smoothly and accurately in six directions by simply rotating two stepper motors at full speed in one direction, and the final one in the opposite direction (see diagram and chart). The speed of one or all of the stepper motors could also be varied in order to make the main sphere move faster or in any direction. In short, the design of v3.2 eliminated all of the engineering issues of the previous models: it presented a highly accurate control mechanism to direct the ball in any direction, at any speed (see Figure 7-54 and Table 17-2 and Table 17-2).<sup>10</sup></p> <p>I built v3.2 in the summer of 2011, at the same time as I began the ultimate stage of testing the Ant Ballet project. The final version, v3.4 assembled after a long pause in project development (assembled December 2014) used a sphere more reminiscent of a Kubrick film: a chromed plastic sphere (with the appearance of a shiny metal), and black tennis balls as actuators. This has yet to be exhibited, for reasons that are discussed in Chapter 1.</p> <ol> <li> <p>When programming, the number 0 is normally the first number.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Wheels designed to rotate in one plane, but allow movement in another.

In order to reduce this cost, the halo was printed in three identical parts, printed close together, then later assembled using the same type of bolts as in Godot Machine v2.x. Having a background in product design, and having been previously subject to the limitations of injection moulding and other traditional manufacturing techniques, it was my ambition to ensure that every 3D printed design I made utilised the potential of the technology to do more than simply creating parts that could be injection moulded, with interlocking components or integrated mechanical systems: hence, in v2.x, the printing of one-part omniwheels and fully integrated articulated lever systems. When printing more straightforward components such as the halo, the parts would always be printed inside a bounding \u2018box\u2019 with wall thickness 0.75mm, with large holes at either end for the removal of excess powder.

Thinking about the analogy of ants in computer systems (this was the same time as initial Godot Machine development), and having read a little about invasive ant species, I approached Dr. Seirian Sumner at the Insitute of Zoology to talk about an ill-formed idea I\u2019d had about invasive insect species being analogous to computer viruses. I had recently read a newspaper article<sup>1</sup> about a species of invasive ants (Lasius neglectus) who had entered the UK for the first time, and were famed for their attraction to electricity \u2013 something that, like the invasive ant Solenopsis invicta in the US, causes them to short-circuit electrical systems.<sup>2</sup> The hypothetical idea that I approached Seirian with was simple: to build a spatially distributed computer, with exposed wiring and components. A colony of invasive ants would then be introduced to cohabit the space with the computer, gradually becoming attracted to the exposed wiring, and biting, short-circuiting and destroying the computer; in effect, becoming a physical computer virus.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>I wrote to Dr. Sumner as I had seen her work identifying nest drifting behaviour of paper wasps, in which her team had placed RFID tags on hundreds of female members of a colony in order to track their movements between nests, and was excited by the innovative way an emergent technology had been used.<sup>4</sup> In conversation, Sumner told me details of the method used to collect, tag, track and analyse results with the wasps, using statistics programmes such as R to produce network visualisations of wasp behaviour.<sup>5</sup> Our conversation carried on for far longer than our allocated appointment time, and we both were excited by the others\u2019 perspective on our own work. We agreed to meet again to develop ideas further.</p> <p>By the next time we met, I had carried out more paper research into insect communication systems (of which olfaction is the most common<sup>6</sup>) and had developed a particular interest in ant pheromones. Jackson and Morgan describe these mechanisms in the paper Insect Chemical Communication: Pheromones and exocrine glands of ants.<sup>7</sup> They explain semiochemicals \u2013 that is, chemicals which allow for information exchange between organisms \u2013\u00a0can be divided into two main categories: alleochemics allow intra-species communication, whilst pheromones allow for communication within the same species. Pheromones either work as a primer, a semiochemical which causes a physiological change to the recipient, or a releaser, a semiochemical typically emitted from an ants\u2019 Dufour gland, and encoded into the environment.<sup>8</sup> Releaser pheromones trigger seven main (occasionally overlapping) types of behaviour, signalling: sex, aggregation, dispersal, alarm, trail, territory, or surface.<sup>9</sup> These pheromone signals can display extraordinary complexity. The majority of technical papers describing ant pheromones and colony-wide behaviour are concerned with trail pheromones and emergent properties that arise from collective problem-solving. Notable among these are the works of Dorigo et al. initated in the 1990s.<sup>10</sup></p> <p>A year or so before starting Ant Ballet, I had been involved in a project at the Royal College of Art (RCA) initiated by artist and activist Cesar Harada, entitled Open_Sailing. It was whilst spending time in the RCA\u2019s (now defunct) Design Interactions department that I became aware of the World Transhumanist Association,<sup>11</sup> a group whose aim is to improve the \u2018human condition\u2019 through augmenting and artificially improving human bodies, claiming transhumanists\u2019 desire to \u2018extend their mental and physical (including reproductive) capacities and to improve their control over their own lives. We seek personal growth beyond our current biological limitations.\u2019<sup>12</sup> Several of the RCA students were working on projects that related to \u2018biohacking\u2019, the deliberate alteration of the human body to adjust its natural capabilities (for example, the surgical placement of small magnets in the fingertips to allow for the detection of electromagnetic fields). At the time, I was intrigued by the world of online forums and tutorials that existed to support such activities, but surprised that so much of the work was purely focused on human experience. I could find little evidence of similar \u2018hacking\u2019 of animal systems, despite the wealth of pre-existing scientific knowledge that might be used for such a purpose.<sup>13</sup></p> <p>I developed the idea of using ant pheromones (rather than my previous notion of electricity) to control ant movement. Much had been written about the redundancy and optimisation abilities of ant trails, and the potential to control invasive species through pheromone manipulation (using synthetic pheromone traps to lead ants to poison traps, for example<sup>14</sup>). I had yet to see artificial ant pheromones used in an attempt to communicate with ants, or to manipulate their behaviour for artistic purposes. The idea of creating a choreographed movement of an ant colony was both absurd<sub>a</sub> and technically challenging. I was already working on the Godot Machine and the equipment necessary to create an ant ballet would serve as an extension of my desire to create a functional diagrammatic machine. Over the coming months I would work out how the machine worked, and what it was a diagram of.</p> Figure 7-55:  The Ant Ballet machine midperformance in Barcelona. Photo by the author. <p>I spoke to several entomologists besides Dr. Sumner about the project, asking for advice or precedents. The first difficulty I came across with the project was the difficulty in accessing ant pheromones; they are not something available to the mass-market (I suspect due to low commercial interest). Identification of pheromones is complex and highly specialised, and even when the components of ants\u2019 glands have been analysed, the function that each semiochemical has, and the methods and densities in which they are used, are still not known. I came across a website called the Pherobase<sup>15</sup> which lists known pheromones in insect species, and often the papers which originally identified these compositions. This became an invaluable resource. It was at this stage that I developed a basic set of rules that the project would adopt.</p> Figure 7-56:  Beginning work on Ant Ballet in Barcelona. Photo by the author. <p>One of the entomologists I spoke to dismissively recommended that I use sugar-water to create the illusion of ant trails, and cited an occasion that they had used this method for a sugar television advert several years ago.<sup>16</sup> My immediate reaction was repulsion; given my desire for Kubrickian attention to detail, the idea of tricking an audience into thinking that the ants were doing one action when in fact they were doing another seemed reminiscent of the Disney documentary White Wilderness, in which the filmmakers reputedly staged shots which made it appear as if thousands of lemmings committed mass suicide by leaping off a cliff and swimming to sea.<sup>17</sup> Such inauthenticity would have no place in the project; one of my central goals with the project was authenticity rather than cinematic effect. It would be relatively easy to pretend to make ants dance using sugar water (or clever video editing, or any manner of other tricks), but appropriating their communication protocol in order to subtly change their behaviour would take hard work. Thus, the work would be produced according to two rules:</p> <ol> <li> <p>The project must accurately depict a diagram of the Theatre of the Absurd</p> </li> <li> <p>The project should not be dismissable by scientists. This does not mean it needs to result in a published paper, but rather that it cannot use fakery.</p> </li> </ol> <p>The method of achieving (1) and (2) is to really do everything necessary to make ants dance. This also meant a high risk of failure: attempting something that had not been achieved before, which relied on a relatively high amount of scientific knowledge, for artistic merit, is intentionally risky. I am also happiest working when I am outside my comfort zone, making a project that could really fail.<sup>18</sup> My conversations with Dr. Sumner continued periodically throughout the project, and continued to shape and influence the direction the project took.</p>"},{"location":"2_Appendix/7.3.2-ant-ballet-development/#pheromone-synthesis","title":"Pheromone synthesis","text":"<p>After numerous attempts to speak to experts in biochemistry (both in industry and academia) about the feasibility of ant pheromone synthesis, I began a dialogue with Professor Jim Anderson of UCL Organic Chemistry and Chemical Biology. <sup>19</sup> Anderson\u2019s profile states that \u2018work in his laboratory covers a broad portfolio of projects that combine contemporary synthetic organic chemistry methodology with highly adventurous, blue sky research.\u2019<sup>20</sup> In our initial conversation, he told me about numerous semiochemical effects that had been well documented, including 'Azadirachtin', a natural substance emitted by neem trees which repels locusts, and some of the intricacies of pheromone synthesis (including the concept of compound chirality).<sup>21</sup> Anderson offered to help with the synthesis of pheromones, providing expertise, materials and lab time, on the condition that we could identify pheromones that would be relatively easy to synthesise. I downloaded datasheets for every ant species available on the Pherobase at the time, then devised a matrix of conditions that pheromones would have to meet to be considered for synthesis.<sup>22</sup> In order to be considered, a species\u2019 trail pheromone had to have been identified; the trail pheromone had to consist of one chemical (many pheromone trails are multi-component); the semiochemical had to have a low number of chiral bonds; and the species had to be fairly common somewhere in Europe so that I could get hold of some to test with.<sup>23</sup></p> <p>After researching the handful of species who met all of the criteria, one emerged as the most suitable. Linepithema humile, or the Argentine ant, is a well-documented invasive species who have recently spread around the world due to human travel.<sup>24</sup> Their trail compound comprises the hydrocarbon (Z)-9-hexadecenal (Z9-l6:Ald), and I found two papers describing different ways the pheromone had been synthesised and used as attractant for ants.<sup>25</sup> In a 1981 paper, Vorhis Key and Baker used synthetic pheromone to cause ants to follow a synthetic trail along a circular shape 14cm in diameter; <sup>26</sup> Tanaka et al, opting for a brute-force approach, testing synthetic pheromone as a pure attractant, placed in pots along pre-existing ant trails with the intention seemingly just to generate confusion among ants (an approach they filed a patent for in 2005).<sup>27</sup> Professor Anderson assigned the reproduction of the pheromone, bonded to silica powder (which had not been seen in any of the papers) to undergraduate student Jack Bestwick. A few months after our initial meeting, I was presented with approximately 3.5kg of silica powder, containing approximately 0.8g of synthesised pheromone.</p> <p>In the meantime, I set about researching the species we had chosen. Since L humile had spread extensively around Europe, most closely to the northwestern coast of Spain, it seemed logical to me to simply import ants from there.<sup>28</sup> However, it was upon talking to Dr. Sumber that I realised how invasive this particular species is, and what a risk to native ecosystems it would be to risk bringing any ants into the UK. Biologists Wetterer and Wetterer describe the species exhibits supercolonising traits, meaning that they form huge colonies with millions of queens which can stretch over vast distances. Ants from any nest within the supercolony can be introduced to ants from any other nest within the supercolony, and unlike most species, they will not fight. This gives them a huge advantage over local species, in that they do not lose members of the colony to intracolonial aggression.<sup>29</sup> The species has spread around the world, and the largest known supercolony is over 6,000km long, stretching through \u2018Spain, Portugal, southern France and Italy\u2019.<sup>30</sup></p> <p>The realisation that it would be irresponsible to introduce L humile to the UK presented a real change to the design logic of the project. Until that point, I had been working on designs that presented the Ant Ballet as a machine, of approximately 2m diameter. My assumption had been that the manufacture of the machine would largely take place in the Bartlett workshop (with bespoke parts perhaps carried out via subcontracted waterjet-cut steel or aluminium). I realised that the testing of the pheromone would have to take place abroad, and that subsequently, all of the machinery would have to be designed to be taken abroad. At the time I had access to my sister\u2019s car, a Volkswagen Polo, and a number of contacts in Barcelona, a city where L humile was well documented.<sup>31</sup> I decided that the best way to resolve the project was to design and build the entire machinery to fit into the back of a hatchback car, and carry out all tests there. I believe that this decision was something that changed the nature of the project: rather than being a potentially eccentric, slightly absurd project that took place in north London,<sup>32</sup> I began designing and building an elaborate testing apparatus, with robotic control system, having also commissioned the manufacture of synthetic pheromones, to drive roughly 3200km on a round-trip \u2013 all for the purpose of slightly confusing some 5mm long ants. In many of the plays associated with the Theatre of the Absurd, the control systems that are expressed are highly abstract, removed and have strange behaviours. Like a character in a play, the ants would have no idea of the effort that had been put into the construction of an elaborate literal and figurative mechanism to change their behaviour. Much of the absurdity alluded to in this project is inspired by the plot structure of Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s novel Sirens of Titan, wherein it is revealed slowly through the course of the book that increasingly abstract methods have been in place to subtly (and not-so-subtly) affect human behaviour through history, with a completely trivial outcome.<sup>33</sup></p> <p>Given the cinematic and theatrical origins of much of the projects\u2019 inspiration, I conceived of the testing of ant pheromones as a performative act. This was, after all, not a rigorous scientific test (despite involving the participation of scientists), but rather the entire work was a diagram that could best be expressed through film. My initial designs for test apparatus had been based on the assumption that pheromones, like those within ant gasters, would be liquid in form. I drew inspiration from the William Blake etching Ancient of Days (God as an Architect);<sup>34</sup> where Blake was presenting a monothiastic deity creating the world from on-high, the Ant Ballet machine would be using a similarly top-down, hierarchal approach to interfere with the \u2018emergent\u2019, non-hierarchal system of ant pheromones. Early on in the design process I had decided to construct a round test bed, both as an homage Ken Adams\u2019 War Room in Dr. Strangelove, and in order to prevent the machine looking too much like a large-format printer. My initial designs would use a heavy base material and a large rack-and-pinion set pair of \u2018compasses\u2019, mounted above the table surface, to draw pheromone trails, but as the criteria for the design changed to require packing and transportation via small car to Barcelona, the designs themselves changed. Having worked through a series of designs, I was encouraged to consider using a centrally-placed robotic arm emerging from the centre of the table itself by Ruairi Glynn (this would be far easier to assemble and calibrate off-site).</p> <p>My final designs for the device itself took much from the sci-fi aesthetic of the 1974 cult film Phase IV, in which ants in the US desert develop psychic communication abilities and take over a scientific research station towards an unspecified catastrophic outcome in four seemingly coordinated phases.<sup>35</sup> The table was made entirely from aluminium. Starting from a heavy, box-section base with over-engineered 4mm-plate aluminium connecting plates, the design would become increasingly light the further it was from the ground. The circular aluminium test bed, in part supported by 10mm diagonal rods from the heavy legs, was in fact made of three layers of laser-cut aluminium.<sup>36</sup> The top layer, only 1mm thick (for cost reasons) was bolted to two 4mm thick support sections. Above the entire structure was a round light made of sections of lasercut aluminium, similar to that seen in Dr. Strangelove.<sup>37</sup> Unseen, in the centre of the light ring, was a webcam much like the setup of the Godot Machine (the intention being to use this during phase II onwards). The robotic arm was modelled on the contours of my own arm in order that it would have some sort of anthropomorphic, performative quality. I imported high-torque servos from the US to enable the control of the robotic arm.<sup>38</sup> I also set about constructing a basic control programme for the robotic arm via Processing and Arduino. The control mechanism consisted of a diagram of the machine in plan. Various versions were built that enabled both mouse input (as seen below) and autonomous control of the arms\u2019 movement in pre-choreographed or semi-random patterns.</p> <p>I worked through numerous dispersal mechanisms for the powdered pheromones. The eventual design I employed used a glass laboratory pipette with thin end attached to a silicon input pipe for pheromones, and attached to a 3D-printed with a vibration motor of the style found in mobile phones. When the vibration motor was activated, a fine (but not entirely steady) plume of silica powder was spread from the pipette.</p> <p>In Barcelona, the machine was set up in the small town of La Floresta.<sup>39</sup> During the daytime, we met Espalder, who kindly introduced me to a local prolific nest, taught me how to identify L humile (a technique by which one crushes a few of the ants, and smells the result for a vaguely almond-y scnet) and how to collect them. By this time, I had read many papers on ant behaviour, and spoken to several experts, but until this stage, I had not thought about the human element of these studies. For every clinically-written paper about testing trail following, in all likelihood someone in the lab had to go to a site, identify a certain species of ant, and use a device called an aspirator (made of tubing, cork and stockings) to manually suck ants into a tube then place them in a flourin-lined tub.<sup>40</sup> The almond-y smell of L humile, after a few minutes\u2019 sucking, translated to a bitter taste that hangs in the back of the throat for the next day or so. Espalder told me much about practicalities of collecting, settling and keeping ants. Ants require 24-48 hours in one place to settle, and display more natural behaviour when they have brood to take care of, he said. They like to be fed a weak solution of honey or sugar in water or milk.<sup>41</sup> We set the ants up in nests of pine tree bark and leaves on the machine\u2019s test bed. The ants themselves were incredibly small, and kept finding new ways to escape from the machine.<sup>42</sup> It also became apparent that aluminium offers little for ants to grip: the slightest breeze could clear the table of ants. Fortunately, there was not much wind in Barcelona in July, particularly in the middle of a forest. Re-stocking the ant nest became a near-daily task. There were also numerous issues relating to the technicalities of running an experimental robotic machine in the middle of a forest, and it required constant maintenance. We tried numerous iterations of power supplies, running cables from the nearby house to the forest. Several components were replaced with supplies from local hardware shops.</p> <p>Whilst setting up the machine, I also developed storyboards to work out how to explain the experiments visually. In London, I had approached the Metropolitan Police to ask what the protective clothing would be if there were a Phase IV-style ant outbreak in the city. I had been informed that Tyvek overalls, rubber gloves and respirators would likely do. Therefore, the \u2018experimenters\u2019 in the film would, at all times, wear this uniform.<sup>43</sup> The entire performance would take place in visual form only, so that there was no dialogue, and each component of the system would be displayed and introduced much like a character, complete with title card. The first shot would establish the location of the machine, in the middle of a forest. It seemed essential to me to show the context \u2013 particularly as the setting up of the machine in this location had incurred so much effort. I wanted an engaging, dynamic opening shot that revealed the machine. I built a dolly system using 50m of climbing rope that enabled a camera to move through the forested valley and reveal the machine.<sup>44</sup> It took several iterations, including various methods of controlling camera movement and reducing shake, to actually achieve the shot. The final device was remarkably low-tech: it used a towel to dampen movement, and the camera was launched down the dolly in free-fall.<sup>45</sup> Although only on-screen for a couple of seconds, the shot establishes the location and the machine, grounding the experiment in an indistinct place.</p> <p>After the opening shot, the two human characters are introduced; the fact that they are unidentifiable and wearing Tyvek suits and respirators indicates that there is at least a sci-fi, if not a scientific, bias. Title cards introduce the major elements of the projects, such as \u2018ANTS: linepthinema humile\u2019 or \u2018PHEROMONE: z-9-hexadecanal\u2019. Modelled on the on-screen graphics of HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey<sup>46</sup>, a subtly rotating graphic outline of the object, alongside widely-spaced one-word description<sup>47</sup> and a small description line. The title cards are immediately followed by a shot of the item being used, shot in a mode that deliberately mimics 1960s/70s cinematography: jump cuts, static in-camera pan-and-zoom. All of these shots were filmed over the first few days of the machine being in the forest, and were storyboarded in advance. The \u2018machine waking up\u2019 shot, in which the robot arm rises from a \u2018sleeping\u2019 position and becomes active (following a slide introducing the machine performing \u2018choreography sequence CRM-114\u2019) showed an error in machine calibration where in switching on, a cloud of silica powder was released \u2013\u00a0but this made for a more dramatic shot than every one where the machine simply switched on.<sup>48</sup></p> <p>In order to echo the absurdity of Dr. Strangelove, and create an absurd<sub>b</sub> diagram, I had wanted the storyboard to be visually reminiscent of the Ken Adams-designed war room. The experiment would similarly take place in a dark space, with the sole light source being a light ring suspended above. However, each time the ants were set up in colonies, and artificial pheromone trails were laid at night, the ants did not react at all. This was frustrating, as this was a different behaviour to that displayed when conducting manual pheromone tests in the park they were collected from (ants had in this case followed the trails). With the logistical issues of escaping ants and mechanical failures, and only wanting to film at night, the project was nearing the date we had to pack up and drive home. On the final night of filming the machine and the ants \u2013\u00a0and in fact the only night I managed to film the ants all night \u2013\u00a0it appeared that after laying a trail all night, no ants were following the trail. I was severely demotivated. Just as we were preparing to break the machine down to head home, thinking the experiment had been a total failure, my colleague went down to the machine to visually assess the task ahead. It was then \u2013\u00a0around 9.30 in the morning \u2013\u00a0that she noticed the ants were following the trails that had been laid overnight. In retrospect, this made sense: we had witnessed the ants\u2019 behaviour change throughout the day whilst collecting them. In the mornings, the ants would create trails on one side to forage for food, and shift throughout the day towards other non-food related activities. Now on the test bed they were exhibiting similar behaviour: waking up in the morning, they were clearly hungry, and looking for the remnants of the trails that they expected to find from the previous day. The trails they encountered were the synthetic ones laid by the machine.<sup>49</sup> By this time, having filmed all night, all of the camera batteries had been depleted, save a pocket-camera; this is the one that was used to shoot the final scenes in the film where the ants actually follow the pheromone trails.</p> <p>On return to London, I began compiling the video and documentation of the project. My initial focus was on the short overview of the project. The video is a composite, filmed over two weeks: the human performances are staged and stylised, but the ant behaviour is real. My initial cut of the video was around 3 minutes long, but this was pared down to exclude any shot \u2013 including several that had taken time and effort to film\u00a0\u2013 to 1 minute 38 seconds. I wanted the film to contain as little extraneous detail as possible, so that it could be easily understood by a wide audience. The ease of comprehension is crucial to the legibility of the absurd<sub>b</sub> diagram.</p>"},{"location":"2_Appendix/7.3.2-ant-ballet-development/#chapter-bibliography","title":"Chapter bibliography","text":"<p>Aleisha Scott. \u2018\u201cElectric\u201d Ants Seen in UK for First Time - Nature, Environment - The Independent\u2019.

Argentine Invasion.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>The Bartlett, UCL Organic Chemistry and the Institute of Zoology are all located within 3km of each other.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Kurt Vonnegut, The Sirens of Titan (New York: Delacorte Press, 1959).\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>William Blake, Ancient of Days (God as an Architect), Relief etching with watercolor, 1794, http://www.artcyclopedia.com/masterscans/l24.html.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Saul Bass, Phase IV, 1974.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Credit for this design lies with Heechan Park; the style of the support struts was modelled after the Apollo 11 lunar lander.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>When this light was finally erected from between two trees in the forest outside Barcelona, in the dead of night, from a steel wire between two trees, the neighbour further down the hill, unaware of the experiment taking place on the adjacent plot of land, mistook the ring of light for a landing alien spacecraft and locked themselves into their house for most of the evening, venturing up to our encampment only once the light had stabilised (and with the protection of a yapping dog).\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>The imperial measurements and bolts used by the American servos caused several annoying issues whilst building the machine.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>The precise location of the machine was 41\u00b0 26' 36.9168'' N, 2\u00b0 5' 27.7692'' E.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Flourin is a specialist PTFE-derived lubricant which is used by entomologists to line things insects may escape from. It is invariably messy to apply to anything, and seems specially formulated to stick to clothes.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Professor Espalder informed me that they don\u2019t have the suction strength to enable consumption of raw honey.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Flourin would not bind to the machine\u2019s aluminium, so a moat of motor oil became the main defence against ant escape.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>In reality these roles were played myself and my colleague Helen Floate, who kindly assisted with the journey, experiment and filmmaking. The heat of the Barcelona forest in the middle of summer, along with the presence of tiger mosquitoes, made the process unbearable.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Today, this would be easy to film via drone, but such technologies were not readily available in 2011.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>One camera was also completely destroyed/lost in the process.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>I visited the Kubrick Archives to see the original plates for the HAL graphics in preparation for this film.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Set in thin DIN type\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>CRM-114 is a reference to Kubrick\u2019s constant use of the code throughout his films. In Dr. Strangelove, for example, CRM-114 is the communication-scrambling device whose failure causes the final line of communication between the bombers and their command-station to break down; in A Clockwork Orange, Serum 114 (a homophone for CRM-114) is the drug given to the lead protagonist to \u2018cure\u2019 his illness.

And we are in danger, not you.\nLove is different for different people.\nLove is funny.\nLove is just another name for sex.

See chapter 2 for details. The result, although just computer training data, was oddly poetic, and could be read as a series of snapshots or glimpses of a romantic relationship - and consequently, I used it as a reading at my wedding.</p> <p>The lines were compiled from 617 films spanning over 50 years from the Cornell Movie Dialogs Corpus. Films quoted in this reading include Apocalypse Now, Jaws, Sideways, Fargo, Airplane II, Magnolia, Pretty Woman, Austin Powers, Vertigo and more - see this file for the list of films.</p> <p>The source code is available at https://github.com/olliepalmer/48lines/.</p>"}]}
