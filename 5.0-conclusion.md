Conclusion 
===========

This thesis has discussed various definitions and interpretations of the notions of *script* through its four chapters, showing a progression of ideas through a series of design projects. The presentation of projects in this order displays a thematic development of work, in an order that is loosely synonymous with the order in which the projects were developed. The design research has taken the form of installation, performance, software, and film, and used definitions of scripting ranging from behavioural scripting in animals (*Godot Machine* and *Ant Ballet*), to performative scripting (*Nybble*, *Scriptych*), to computer scripting (*Ant Ballet*, *Scriptych*, *86400*, *24fps Psycho*), and finally, a scripted design process (*Network/Intersect*).

Chapter one focused on *behavioural scripting* through two projects, the *Godot Machine* and *Ant Ballet*. The latter was a performative attempt to script the behaviour of ants via the use of synthetic pheromones. Using Bateson’s concept of psychological framing (which shares a number of concepts with both Schank and Abelson, and Tomkins’ script theories), the chapter discussed the framing of both of these projects in relation to the field of ‘sci-art’ in which they were initially presented. It concluded that my practice is best defined as work that is informed, but not defined, by an engagement with other disciplines, including science; and that my approach to the work was more influenced by the methodology of Stanley Kubrick, setting rules bounding the authenticity of a work, than a desire to communicate scientific principles. The project’s main mode of presentation to the public was via a series of short films, and models which simulated the effect of the Ant Ballet machine’s experiments in Barcelona.

Chapter two presented two projects which had computational scripting at their core, but which performed the actions of computers through dance. Both projects were shown at major cultural institutions: *Nybble*, performed at the V&A Museum, was a large diagram of the inner workings of a computing machine, with performers blindly following scripted instructions in front of a live audience; *Scriptych*, performed at the Opera Garnier, used performance scripts, computer scripts, and data from Hollywood film scripts to perform an interaction with a three-dimensional word-vector database. Both projects were performed in front of live audiences, but also exist in filmed documentation.

Chapter three focused on computational scripting, using a pair of projects (*86400* and *24fps Psycho*) as a mode of critiquing specific contemporary technologies. These projects represent a mode of practice I call *computational curation*, whereby software is used to synthesise pre-existing content into a new form. The computationally-generated film *86400* employed a script to interact with the Google Image Search API, creating a database of hundreds of thousands of time-related images, which were compiled into a 24-hour-long film: the work was a diagram seeking to create an immersive critique of the endless onslaught of classification that is pervasive in digital culture, and in turn to highlight its meaninglessness. *24fps Psycho* used computational scripting, and a diagrammatic computer interface (Max) to create an ultimately unsuccessful film that was performed live in front of an audience. The chapter discussed the various reasons for this projects’ failures, and speculated that such a project will likely appear computationally naïve as future technologies develop which render the machine learning tasks attempted easy.

Chapter four presented my first explicit use of a novel scripted design process entitled *Reflexive Scripted Design*, in which a designer creates a set of absurd<sub>a</sub> rules based on research and reflection; the rules are then performed back into the work, with the aim of creating an absurd<sub>a+b</sub> work whose form reflects its content. The novel process is derived from methodologies of the Punchdrunk theatre company and the Oulipo, and through ideas explored in this thesis. The process was used to create a short fiction film, *Network/Intersect*, in which two characters working in the production of internet propaganda and financial instruments lose the ability to delineate the abstract ideas which they use to justify their work and their lived realities. The extent to which *Reflexive Scripted Design*, and elements of the process, can be found explicitly and implicitly in all of my work will be discussed here.

This conclusion will discuss the findings of the chapters, highlighting similarities and differences across projects, methodologies and media; the position of my work in relation to the fields in which I practice; the implications of the notions of scripting I have discussed in this thesis for design in general, and in particular, for the modes of film-making I have employed; the ways in which I carry out practice-led research; and the original contributions to knowledge that can be found in this thesis. It will also briefly discuss shortcomings of the research and future avenues of research, aiming to clearly situate my work within a wider field of design, and film.

### Thesis / practice

This thesis describes a series of projects in which the roles of research and practice are intertwined. The practical design work described in this thesis refuses to stick to any one medium; projects use computation, installation, performance, film, sound design, and more. As such, the categorisation of the work itself, and the role that this thesis plays in describing the work, is not straightforward. This conclusion attempts to describe the relationship between the theoretical content of this thesis, and the practice embodied in the work it describes, beginning by identifying the elements crucial to the production of my work.

In chapter one I introduced Born and Barry’s description of *epidexis*: the ‘public experiment’.[1] All of the work described in this thesis might be considered a form of epidexis; the work is both driven by, and drives, research, which is often performed for a public. The production of work in this way is a mode of thinking through making, a form of knowledge creation that could not be achieved (or engaged with by an audience) through isolated research or design work. This is consistent with arguments put forth in Brad Haseman’s 2006 paper, *A Manifesto for Performative Research*.[2] Haseman describes ‘performative research’ as a ‘multi-method’ mode of research which is ‘led by practice’. This contrasts a purely quantitative or qualitative method.[3] Haseman uses the term *performance* in two ways: work is *performed* both as an action (e.g. work is *carried out*), and also *performed* as an act in front of an audience.[4] All of the works in this thesis were publically shown, and several publically shown in multiple media.[5] *Ant Ballet*, for example, was shown as a documented performance and in multiple different iterations in exhibitions; *Scriptych* was performed in front of a live audience, and a film documenting the performance then shown to new audiences in film festivals. This public exhibition is crucial to my practice; my work represents my attemprs to communicate ideas that I believe are important and interesting, and performance through exhibition is central to this communication. Born and Barry’s introduction of *epidexis*, whilst originally targeted towards sci-art projects, is an accurate description of my particular mode of scripted design practice.[6]

In the introduction I discussed various meanings of the term script. When viewed through the lens of performative research, almost all of these can also be linked to the idea of performance. The root of *scribere* (to scratch) is a gestural movement, and thus an act that must be performed. The behavioural scripting described by Tomkins relies on the performance of *scripts* in order to create affect in humans; in Schank and Abelson’s version of script theory, people perform pre-set roles in scenes they can easily decipher through their common ordering. Computer scripts are performed by computers; *Reflexive Scripted Design* is performed by a designer. In the projects described by this thesis are numerous performances: computers performed their scripts to an audience in *24fps Psycho*; ants’ reactions to synthetic pheromones unwittingly became a performance in *Ant Ballet*, as did the actions of myself as the projects’ protagonist*;* dancers performed as a computer and with a computer respectively in *Nybble* and *Scriptych*; and so on. There is an inherent connection between the script in its various manifestations, and the need for the script to be performed in some way. In this manner, my work, scripted, performed, and shown to a public, is both Born and Barry’s *epidexis*, as well as a manifestation of Haseman’s notion of *performative research*. This then poses a question: if the performance of design work is to be taken as a mode of research in itself, what then is the role of research in this thesis? How do the research in description of work and methods in the thesis relate to the embedded knowledge that is contained in the work itself? And what are the original contributions to knowledge that this thesis claims?

### Thesis

It is tempting when writing accounts of the creation of completed design work to apply a clear, linear narrative to their development. This is what I had been taught to do throughout my entire design education, and commercial work, until doctoral level: after employing a development process that inevitably went along dead-ends, encompassed multiple failures, did not know the scope of the problems it was intended to solve, and was generally messy and confused, the designer is to provide a clear, concise, and logical account of the design process which avoids the messiness, leading to the illusion that the process was straightforward, and to a certain extent, the result was deterministic. This mode of post-rationalisation often requires the retrospective redefinition of the design process as an iterative series of technical problems to be solved, rather than a
