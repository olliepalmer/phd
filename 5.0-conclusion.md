Conclusion 
===========

This thesis has discussed various definitions and interpretations of the notions of *script* through its four chapters, showing a progression of ideas through a series of design projects. The presentation of projects in this order displays the thematic development of my design research work over the past few years in a roughly chronological order, articulating a series of related enquiries through a body of work that encompasses installation, performance, software, and film, and with definitions of scripting ranging from behavioural scripting in animals (*Godot Machine* and *Ant Ballet*), to performative scripting (*Nybble*, *Scriptych*), to computer scripting (*Ant Ballet*, *Scriptych*, *86400*, *24fps Psycho*), and finally, a scripted design process (*Network/Intersect*).

Chapter one focused on *behavioural scripting* through two projects, the *Godot Machine* and *Ant Ballet*. The latter was a performative attempt to script the behaviour of ants via the use of synthetic pheromones. Using Bateson’s concept of psychological framing (which shares a number of concepts with both Schank and Abelson, and Tomkins’ script theories), the chapter discussed the framing of both of these projects in relation to the field of ‘sci-art’ in which they were initially presented. It concluded that my practice is best defined as work that is informed, but not defined, by an engagement with other disciplines, including science; and that my approach to the work was more influenced by the methodology of Stanley Kubrick, setting rules bounding the authenticity of a work, than a desire to communicate scientific principles. The project’s main mode of presentation to the public was via a series of short films, and models which simulated the effect of the Ant Ballet machine’s experiments in Barcelona.

Chapter two presented two projects which had computational scripting at their core, but which performed the actions of computers through dance. Both projects were shown at major cultural institutions: *Nybble*, performed at the V&A Museum, was a large diagram of the inner workings of a computing machine, with performers blindly following scripted instructions in front of a live audience; *Scriptych*, performed at the Opera Garnier, used performance scripts, computer scripts, and data from Hollywood film scripts to perform an interaction with a three-dimensional word-vector database. Both projects were performed in front of live audiences, but also exist in filmed documentation.

Chapter three focused on computational scripting, using a pair of projects (*86400* and *24fps Psycho*) as a mode of critiquing specific contemporary technologies. These projects represent a mode of practice I call *computational curation*, whereby software is used to synthesise pre-existing content into a new form. The computationally-generated film *86400* employed a script to interact with the Google Image Search API, creating a database of hundreds of thousands of time-related images, which were compiled into a 24-hour-long film: the work was a diagram seeking to create an immersive critique of the endless onslaught of classification that is pervasive in digital culture, and in turn to highlight its meaninglessness. *24fps Psycho* used computational scripting, and a diagrammatic computer interface (Max) to create an ultimately unsuccessful film that was performed live in front of an audience. The chapter discussed the various reasons for this projects’ failures, and speculated that such a project will likely appear computationally naïve as future technologies develop which render the machine learning tasks attempted easy.

Chapter four presented my first explicit use of a novel scripted design process entitled *Reflexive Scripted Design*, in which a designer creates a set of absurd<sub>a</sub> rules based on research and reflection; the rules are then performed back into the work, with the aim of creating an absurd<sub>a+b</sub> work whose form reflects its content. The novel process is derived from methodologies of the Punchdrunk theatre company and the Oulipo, and through ideas explored in this thesis. The process was used to create a short fiction film, *Network/Intersect*, in which two characters working in the production of internet propaganda and financial instruments lose the ability to delineate the abstract ideas which they use to justify their work and their lived realities. The extent to which *Reflexive Scripted Design*, and elements of the process, can be found explicitly and implicitly in all of my work will be discussed here.

This conclusion will discuss the findings of the chapters, highlighting similarities and differences across projects, methodologies and media; the position of my work in relation to the fields in which I practice; the implications of the notions of scripting I have discussed in this thesis for design in general, and in particular, for the modes of film-making I have employed; the ways in which I carry out practice-led research; and the original contributions to knowledge that can be found in this thesis. It will also briefly discuss shortcomings of the research and future avenues of research.
