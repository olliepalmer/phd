Conclusion
==========

*Summary of main part of text.*

-   Thesis has discussed various definitions and interpretations of the term script and act of scripting through four chapters and seven design projects, ranging from behavioural scripting in animals (*Godot Machine* and *Ant Ballet*) to scripted performances (Nybble, Scriptych) to computer scripting (AB, 86400, 24fps Psycho), to scripted design (N/I). Projects presented in both a thematic, and roughly chronological fashion. Main points from each chapter summarised here:

    -   Ch1 behavioural scripting: attempting to control ants via synthetic pheromones. Work fell within the realm of sci-art; however, I argued that the frame in which work is presented changes the way in which work is received; this work had more in common with the film work of Stanley Kubrick than the sci-art community. Introduced my concept of ‘diagramming’. Projects themselves bounded by rules which not nevessarily visible to an audience.

    -   Ch2 two projects which had computer scripting at their core, but which performed the actions of a computer through dance. Nyb was a large diagram of the workings id a machine; Scriptych used scripts on multiple levels (performance scripts, computer scriptes, Hollywood scropts).

    -   Ch3 was exclusively computational scripts; both projects made use of ‘computational curation’ to find footage from existing sources and reorder / remix them in new ways.

    -   Ch4 was first explicit use of scripted design process; learning about scripts from other projects used to create something truly absurd; a series of ridiculous rules which the designer performs back into their work. the reach and implications of the RSD process will be discussed in this conclusion; the extent to which it (and elements thereof) is used explicitly and implicitly in my work.

-   Conclusion will discuss *the findings of these chapters; the position of my work in the wider context (where do I position myself); the implications of scripting for design in general, and in particular, for film-making; the role of practice-led research(?); the original contributions to knowledge of this thesis*.

> *Deduction made on thesis body*

-   *Synergy between projects and theory in thesis; how both contribute to new knowledge.*

    -   In Ch1 introduced idea of epidexis: ‘the art of showing in front, in the presence of a public, to make a show’. Work is design-led research; the work is driven by, and drives, research; thinking through making. All works publically shown (w exception of Godot Machine, which is included in thesis purely as it was first ‘diagram’ project; not shown purely because AB took over and my overall direction changed!). Showing to public is v important to my practice; work attempts to communicate ideas, exhibition or performance is central to this. Performance is central to this; I have discussed different forms of performance of scripts in thesis: computers performing scripted instructions, people performing scripted instructions, designer performing scripted instructions; similarly thesis has involved writing various kinds of scripts. This work really is epidexis. Throughout time working on projects, have carried out research and design work; both inform each other. Neither operates in isolation. For example, writing about APIs and Uber is not purely hypothetical, it comes from experience with those APIs.

    -   Structure of chapters tends to display similar pattern: identifying a subject, then explaining how my design work attempts to engage in conversation with the subject. The process itself is reflexive; as a practitioner I cannot help but imply my subjective viewpoint on the work; in addition the work often uses the media, methods, technologies of the technology in question.

        -   For me practical engagement vital; e.g. N/I’s NYT source article came from discussions with friend (Golo!) about unpublished work I had done with Twitter bots and creating false identities previously.

        -   This highlights an important aspect of work as an artist which hasn’t been discussed: play. None of the projects in this came from nowhere, or were the result of a set brief; all came from a period of playing, experimentation. 86400 was result of learning Python (itself something I had started to do having learnt about Google’s web crawler). The projects presented here have an obvious lineage, but what is seen is the end result of playing, experimentation, conversations, support. This support comes in different forms: conversations and idea-sharing with supervisors, students, colleagues, friends; also physical space and resources. The most active time in the phd was clearly in Paris, but the ideas which came to fruition here – ie my ability to produce multiple projects in a short timeframe – came as a result of earlier ability to play with ideas, technologies, etc.

        -   Physical space. One of the strong points that comes through in Tom Sachs’ films in introduction is the freedom which comes through his studio environment; having all the tools that might be needed *to hand*, a clean workspace ready to make anything, is essential to being able to make the work. Paris was great for this: I had two studios and a nice walk between them. And lots of stimulation thanks to the Palais de Tokyo trips etc, and deadlines, and conversations.

        -   As explored in chapter 3, writing in code puts one into a mindset different from that of writing in language. Building a *thing* requires different mindset still. Reading theoretical writing, technical writing, etc, they’re all different. Theoretical knowledge in this thesis is informed by practical work; practical work informed by theoretical research. Both are intertwined.

        -   As such, I expect that this thesis may be of interest to a critical practitioner of design. (As mentioned in intro, it doesn’t discuss aesthetics.) The thesis presents the methodology to my design practice, as well as case studies. Perhaps my work, my approach, will be of interest to other designers. It certainly isn’t a manual for recreating the projects that I have created; rather, *you could view this thesis as a script (as in screenplay) from which my approach to work might be adapted by another director.*

-   *Examine context in which research lies; not architectural design.*

    -   The above poses a new question: where is this work situated? Work conducted in architecture school, on architectural design phd programme. Work is in multiple media (film, code, machines) and exhibited in different contexts (museums/galleries, film festivals). This is typical of ‘new media’ art(?), perhaps reflects the curatorial approach that museums and galleries take today more than it does my position (for example the V&A Digital Design weekend is relatively new, and reflects general trend towards integrating digital works into museum contexts; take MoMA’s buying of video games, or &lt;other examples, maybe mention Mariana’s work @ V&A?&gt;). Work is clearly different to painting, sculpture, other works.

    -   Aspects of work fall within remit of sci-art (e.g. AB). However, as mentioned in ch1, work is more critical; being framed as sci-art, or even computational art, limits the extent to which it is seen as critical. One of the consistent tenets is that of *honesty*: in AB project had to be *authentic*, ie really happen; in Scriptych, computation had to be live based on feedback; in nybble, dancers really couldn’t know what was going on; in N/I propaganda filmmaking techniques were strictly adhered to. This draws me back to Kubrick, whose films required authenticity in the detail. Film is at the core of what I do. Every project has a filmic element, and film shapes the work throughout the process. Perhaps it’s best I explore this before defining my practice.
