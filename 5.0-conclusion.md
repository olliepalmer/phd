Conclusion
==========

*Summary of main part of text.*

-   Thesis has discussed various definitions and interpretations of the term script and act of scripting through four chapters and seven design projects, ranging from behavioural scripting in animals (*Godot Machine* and *Ant Ballet*) to scripted performances (Nybble, Scriptych) to computer scripting (AB, 86400, 24fps Psycho), to scripted design (N/I). Projects presented in both a thematic, and roughly chronological fashion. Main points from each chapter summarised here:

    -   Ch1 behavioural scripting: attempting to control ants via synthetic pheromones. Work fell within the realm of sci-art; however, I argued that the frame in which work is presented changes the way in which work is received; this work had more in common with the film work of Stanley Kubrick than the sci-art community. Introduced my concept of ‘diagramming’. Projects themselves bounded by rules which not nevessarily visible to an audience.

    -   Ch2 two projects which had computer scripting at their core, but which performed the actions of a computer through dance. Nyb was a large diagram of the workings id a machine; Scriptych used scripts on multiple levels (performance scripts, computer scriptes, Hollywood scropts).

    -   Ch3 was exclusively computational scripts; both projects made use of ‘computational curation’ to find footage from existing sources and reorder / remix them in new ways.

    -   Ch4 was first explicit use of scripted design process; learning about scripts from other projects used to create something truly absurd; a series of ridiculous rules which the designer performs back into their work. the reach and implications of the RSD process will be discussed in this conclusion; the extent to which it (and elements thereof) is used explicitly and implicitly in my work.

-   Conclusion will discuss *the findings of these chapters; the position of my work in the wider context (where do I position myself); the implications of scripting for design in general, and in particular, for film-making; the role of practice-led research(?); the original contributions to knowledge of this thesis*.

> *Deduction made on thesis body*

-   *Synergy between projects and theory in thesis; how both contribute to new knowledge.*

    -   In Ch1 introduced idea of epidexis: ‘the art of showing in front, in the presence of a public, to make a show’. Work is design-led research; the work is driven by, and drives, research; thinking through making. All works publically shown (w exception of Godot Machine, which is included in thesis purely as it was first ‘diagram’ project; not shown purely because AB took over and my overall direction changed!). Showing to public is v important to my practice; work attempts to communicate ideas, exhibition or performance is central to this. Performance is central to this; I have discussed different forms of performance of scripts in thesis: computers performing scripted instructions, people performing scripted instructions, designer performing scripted instructions; similarly thesis has involved writing various kinds of scripts. This work really is epidexis. Throughout time working on projects, have carried out research and design work; both inform each other. Neither operates in isolation. For example, writing about APIs and Uber is not purely hypothetical, it comes from experience with those APIs.

    -   Structure of chapters tends to display similar pattern: identifying a subject, then explaining how my design work attempts to engage in conversation with the subject. The process itself is reflexive; as a practitioner I cannot help but imply my subjective viewpoint on the work; in addition the work often uses the media, methods, technologies of the technology in question.

        -   For me practical engagement vital, as my mode of exploring / reasoning is through experience. Much of the work and themes I am interested in come from sheer curiosity; e.g. N/I’s NYT source article came from discussions with friend (Golo!) about unpublished work I had done with Twitter bots and creating false identities previously (and describing workshop participation w Heath Bunting).

        -   This highlights an important aspect of work as an artist which hasn’t been discussed: play. None of the projects in this came from nowhere, or were the result of a set brief; all came from a period of playing, experimentation. 86400 was result of learning Python (itself something I had started to do having learnt about Google’s web crawler). The projects presented here have an obvious lineage, but what is seen is the end result of playing, experimentation, conversations, support. This support comes in different forms: conversations and idea-sharing with supervisors, students, colleagues, friends; also physical space and resources. The most active time in the phd was clearly in Paris, but the ideas which came to fruition here – ie my ability to produce multiple projects in a short timeframe – came as a result of earlier ability to play with ideas, technologies, etc.

        -   Physical space. One of the strong points that comes through in Tom Sachs’ films in introduction is the freedom which comes through his studio environment; having all the tools that might be needed *to hand*, a clean workspace ready to make anything, is essential to being able to make the work. Paris was great for this: I had two studios and a nice walk between them. And lots of stimulation thanks to the Palais de Tokyo trips etc, and deadlines, and conversations.

        -   As explored in chapter 3, writing in code puts one into a mindset different from that of writing in language. Building a *thing* requires different mindset still. Reading theoretical writing, technical writing, etc, they’re all different. Theoretical knowledge in this thesis is informed by practical work; practical work informed by theoretical research. Both are intertwined.

        -   As such, I expect that this thesis may be of interest to a critical practitioner of design, or someone involved in film or theatrical production. (As mentioned in intro, it doesn’t discuss aesthetics.) The thesis presents the methodology to my design practice, as well as case studies. Perhaps my work, my approach, will be of interest to other designers. It certainly isn’t a manual for recreating the projects that I have created; rather, *you could view this thesis as a script (as in screenplay) from which my approach to work might be adapted by another director.*

-   *Examine context in which research lies; not architectural design.*

    -   The above poses a new question: where is this work situated? Work conducted in architecture school, on architectural design phd programme. Work is in multiple media (film, code, machines) and exhibited in different contexts (museums/galleries, film festivals). This is typical of ‘new media’ art(?), perhaps reflects the curatorial approach that museums and galleries take today more than it does my position (for example the V&A Digital Design weekend is relatively new, and reflects general trend towards integrating digital works into museum contexts; take MoMA’s buying of video games, or &lt;other examples, maybe mention Mariana’s work @ V&A?&gt;). Work is clearly different to painting, sculpture, other works. A uniting factor might be performance.

    -   Aspects of work fall within remit of sci-art (e.g. AB). However, as mentioned in ch1, work is more critical; being framed as sci-art, or even computational art, limits the extent to which it is seen as critical. One of the consistent tenets is that of *honesty*: in AB project had to be *authentic*, ie really happen; in Scriptych, computation had to be live based on feedback; in nybble, dancers really couldn’t know what was going on; in N/I propaganda filmmaking techniques were strictly adhered to. This draws me back to Kubrick, whose films required authenticity in the detail. Film is at the core of what I do. Every project has a filmic element, and film shapes the work throughout the process. Perhaps it’s best I explore this before defining my practice.

        -   Film and design.

        -   All of the projects discussed here have a filmic outcome. As discussed in technical notes in appendix / chapter 1, whilst at the Bartlett I’d started to make films about making machines. This was a natural progression from my interests; in early teens had inherited grandfather’s cameras; father worked in photo processing; I had access to analogue cameras and unlimited films/processing. (Today these resources are @ hand for all kids! But back then this was rarer.) I spent summers taking photos; developed love of photography. This combined with curiosity about technical things (taking objects to pieces etc, working out how systems worked) fed into a love of cinema and film, but also the technology behind film-making. Making films about machines seemed most obvious thing to do!; at first they were exactly that, but with ant ballet, the project took place abroad and therefore the primary focus of the project became making a film to show my work. This framed the decisions made about the machines: what would work most effectively on my budget and would also work onscreen? Unlike many sci-fi films my machines would have to work. thus the beginning of a film-design cycle began.

        -   Since then all projects have taken film into account. How an object or system will look onscreen is one of the main designed outcomes. Scriptych is perhaps epitome of this; the interaction system was deliberately not designed to be seen, but to allow the dancers to articulate their movements to an audience. The computation was hidden, but the framing of the dancers was based around roughly 16:9 formats: the two balconies seen from centre of building; the dancers seen from above (this required consistent negotiations with the paris opera, to get filming rights). Making a film with the live audience was v much my interest and shaped way in which the performance took place.

        -   Similarly N/I was project focused around a film (most obvious example). Design elements included models, all made with forced perspectives, in 16:9 format. All of the rules came back to making a film; making the film was performative, given the absurd rules. The main ‘designed’ outcome – ie the thing most people will see – was the film itself. therefore most of the design of objects were props, sets and scenes for the film. Through process I created a series of technical drawings to work things out: lens-diagrams of the entire inventory within the Palais de Tokyo to show focus lengths/scopes and sensor sizes; these were used to build the rig which was taken to point louis Phillipe(?) bridge to shoot film. (turns out camera didn’t record properly at the time; had to use two other cameras in the end).

        -   These two examples show how the knowledge that something will appear on film affects their outcome. There are interventions in the design of objects based on their onscreen appearance; there are drawings and calculations made about the technicalities of film-making. (\*fn this also extends to the Godot Machine; one of the early tasks I undertook, before the machine had even been designed, was to storyboard and work out how to shoot a film that showed the machine and the ant in one shot; the machine was never finished, and the film was never made. But I did work out the details of the film so that the machine could be designed with that in mind…) This is a central part of the way I design any object: considering how its appearance on a 2D screen will look. This is further shaped by my background in graphic design (my introduction to the field of design was via graphic design; I worked as graphic designer before starting university as a product designer; the influence of joseph muller brockman, Massimo vignelli and dieter rams’ grid systems and typography can be seen clearly in my design work!).

        -   Other way in which film affects is through ‘computational curation’. 86400 / 24fps both projects using computational techniques to create films through ‘archival’ material (google image search / home movies). Computers perform script operations on thousands of works. This is a natural progression from the computational fiction that Calvino talked about in Cybernetics and Ghosts / attempted with Burning of Abominable House. In a sense it’s combinatorics; but an attempt to find human-relatable narratives from disparate elements. In my opinion my attempts in 86400 were success (the film is watchable!) but not in 24fps.

        -   This (comp curation) is a genre of work that I forsee being more important in coming years as artificial intelligence / machine learning become more prevalent and widespread. Already there are companies which auto-tag and categorise video (examples); there is software which determines if films will be Hollywood hit. Adobe are working on means of synthetic voices activated from text; idea of bespoke computationally-generated film curated with textual voiceover just for you is not wildly ambitious.

        -   But 24fps was interested in more than computational curation: it was attempt to spatialise film, break the illusion of movement created on-screen into multiple parts. This is one direction that i want to explore more in future projects: identifying components of film, exploring their meaning. It’s not new; examples from past include Anthony McCall, whose line describing a cone is epitome of spatializing film; Christian Marclay; Douglas Gordon. My work simply integrates algorithms and scripting to it.

    -   Thinking through film is not without restrictions. It is limiting; all of my attempts to think through film have produced films. Even 24fps Psycho, attempt to break film down, was experienced *as a film* (in a cinema, on a screen, as a projection). Whilst limitations occur (I am bound to rectilinear grids!), this also serves to anchor my work in some way.

-   *Original contributions to knowledge.*

-   Perhaps most salient question to ask is what thesis and practice described herein contribute to knowledge. There are two main direct contributions to knowledge: first is technical, a method for interfacing with a 3d database via movement, as designed, prototyped, tested and demonstrated in Scriptych. This is a novel system. But in the spirit of this thesis, is also a consciously absurd<sub>a</sub> one; its operation is a performance; it requires user to learn how to think through the system rather than being intuitive. Whilst computationally logical, it has absurdly high expectations for the user.

    -   Second, and arguably main contribution, is reflexive scritped design. This is novel methodology which was used to create a film in chapter 4 (n/i). It is also somewhat absurd<sub>a</sub>; relying on designer to research, synthesise knowledge gained into a series of rules. The process is made explicit in chapter 4, but in reality it is used implicitly in every other chapter. Elements are hinted at through the introduction; the assessment critera of form, communication and absurd each hint at reflexive scripted design. Difference is Ch4 makes this explicit; codifies and explicates process.

        -   AB is arguably first project to use the process. I carried out much research, developed ideas through conversations, and my own rules about authenticity / believability (themselves inspired by Kubrick) caused project to go to Spain; performance became absurd. Combined scientific literature with performance in context of foothills of barcelona for new work.

        -   Each project since then, with exception of computational curations (86400 and 24fps) also implicitly used RSD. Nybble created rulesets for dancers to follow based on research into Turing / Calvino; roles for team members such as the controller were scripted in advance. Synthesising 1940s computing research with dance in context of v&a.

        -   Scriptych was subject to its own rules (live computation, made process harder; dancers had to learn new system); combined vector space analysis, conversation theory, performance in context of paris opera. Then N/I used process explicitly, codifying methodology. Thus I have been using variants of reflexive scripted design since early 2010s; they form my assessment criteria; this is my contribution.

        -   Seen in this context RSD is a methodology I want to explore further in my own future work, and a practice I would like to develop further through teaching. I will discuss future directions later.

    -   Third contribution is my particular synthesis of script and absurd as means of critically questioning technology. Hope that this has opened up script as a creative and critical tool, both to generate ideas and to enable those ideas to be critical.

    -   These two last intertwined points can be seen as outcomes of the thesis.
