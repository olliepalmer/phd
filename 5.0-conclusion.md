Conclusion
==========

This thesis has discussed various definitions and interpretations of the notions of *script* through its four chapters, showing a progression of ideas through a series of design projects. The presentation of projects in this order displays a thematic development of work, in an order that loosely corresponds with the order in which the projects were developed. The design research has taken the form of installations, performances, software, and films, and has used various definitions of scripting, which range from behavioural scripting in animals (*Godot Machine* and *Ant Ballet*), to performative scripting (*Nybble*, *Scriptych*), to computer scripting (*Ant Ballet*, *Scriptych*, *86400*, *24fps Psycho*), and finally, a scripted design process (*Network / Intersect*).

Chapter 1 focused on behavioural scripting through two projects, the *Godot Machine* and *Ant Ballet*. The latter was a performative attempt to script the behaviour of ants via the use of synthetic pheromones. Using Bateson’s concept of psychological framing (which shares a number of concepts with both Schank and Abelson, and Tomkins’ script theories), the chapter discussed the framing of both of these projects in relation to the field of ‘sci-art’ in which they were initially presented. Furthermore, it argued that my practice is best defined as work that is informed, but not defined, by an engagement with other disciplines, including science; and that a methodology which is bound in rules about authenticity, rather than the communication of scientific principles, is largely influenced by the methodology of Stanley Kubrick. The project’s main mode of presentation to the public was via a series of short films, and models which simulated the effect of the *Ant Ballet* machine’s experiments in Barcelona.

Chapter 2 presented two projects which had computational scripting at their core, but which performed the actions of computers through dance. Both projects were shown at major cultural institutions: *Nybble*, performed at the V&A Museum, was a large diagram of the inner workings of a computing machine, with performers blindly following scripted instructions in front of a live audience; *Scriptych*, performed at the Opera Garnier, used performance scripts, computer scripts, and data from Hollywood film scripts to perform an interaction with a three-dimensional word-vector database. Both projects were performed in front of live audiences, but also exist in filmed documentation. The chapter focused on the experience of writing code, and the ways in which this affects my own thought processes.

Chapter 3 focused on computational scripting, using a pair of projects (*86400* and *24fps Psycho*) as a mode of critiquing specific contemporary technologies. These projects represent a mode of practice I call computational curation, whereby software is used to synthesise pre-existing content into a new form. The computationally-generated film *86400* employed a script to interact with the Google Image Search API, creating a database of hundreds of thousands of time-related images, which were compiled into a 24-hour-long film: the work was a diagram seeking to create an immersive critique of the endless onslaught of classification that is pervasive in digital culture, and in turn to highlight its meaninglessness. *24fps Psycho* used computational scripting, and a diagrammatic computer interface (Max) to create an ultimately unsuccessful film that was performed live in front of an audience. The chapter discussed the various reasons for this projects’ failures, and speculated that such a project will likely appear computationally naïve as future technologies develop which render the machine learning tasks attempted easy.

Chapter 4 presented my first explicit use of a novel scripted design process entitled reflexive scripted design, in which a designer creates a set of absurd<sub>a</sub> rules based on research and reflection; the rules are then performed back into the work, with the aim of creating an absurd<sub>a+b</sub> work whose form reflects its content. The novel process is derived from methodologies of the Punchdrunk theatre company and the Oulipo, and through ideas explored in this thesis. The process was used to create a short fiction film, *Network / Intersect*, in which two characters working in the production of internet propaganda and financial instruments lose the ability to delineate the abstract ideas which they use to justify their work and their lived realities. The chapter concluded that whilst the project in itself was successful, the methodology for reflexive scripted design has been explicitly tested only once; this conclusion will discuss the extent to which it can also be found explicitly and implicitly in all of my work.

The main argument of the thesis is that the notion of script is one that is both important, and underexplored, in contemporary design discourse. The word script is tied to early notions of writing as well as drawing, and is in regular use within theatrical and filmic productions, psychology and computer programming. Within architectural design, however, script is most commonly used in relation to computer scripts, and, by extension, parametric design. This thesis has argued that this narrow understanding of script belies a rich vein of concepts that exhibit potential for new design methodologies, such as reflexive scripted design, which I outlined and tested in chapter 4. This wider understanding of script allows for an architectural discourse that includes conversations about authorship, freedom, and creativity within design.

I have also presented the Camusian ‘absurd<sub>b</sub>’ as a mode of critique, arguing that the themes contained within the plays of the Theatre of the Absurd – originally written in Europe at the beginning of the Cold War – are in fact relevant to present-day uses of technology. The method used to implement this critique has been through the construction of projects which function as absurd diagrams, or absurd machines. The synthesis of these central themes – scripting, the absurd<sub>b</sub>, and diagrammatic practice – and the mode in which they have been explored (through active design research) represents a novel enquiry.

This conclusion will discuss the findings of the work described in the thesis, and the thesis itself, highlighting similarities and differences across projects, methodologies and media; the position of my work in relation to the fields in which I practice; the implications of the notions of scripting I have discussed in this thesis for design in general, and in particular, for the modes of film-making I have employed; the ways in which I carry out practice-led research; and the original contributions to knowledge that can be found in this thesis. It will also briefly discuss shortcomings of the research and future avenues of research, aiming to clearly situate my work within a wider field of design, and film.

### Public experiments

This thesis describes a series of projects in which the roles of research and practice are intertwined. The practical design work described in this thesis refuses to stick to any one medium; projects use computation, installation, performance, film, sound design, and more. As such, the categorisation of the work itself, and the role that this thesis plays in describing the work, is not straightforward. This conclusion attempts to describe the relationship between the theoretical content of this thesis, and the practice embodied in the work it describes, beginning by identifying the elements crucial to the production of my work.

In chapter 1 I introduced Born and Barry’s description of *epideixis*: the ‘public experiment’.[1] All of the work described in this thesis might be considered a form of epideixis; the work is both driven by, and drives, research, which is often performed for a public. The production of work in this way is a mode of thinking through making, a form of knowledge creation that could not be achieved (or engaged with by an audience) through isolated research or design work. This is consistent with arguments put forth in Brad Haseman’s 2006 paper, *A Manifesto for Performative Research*.[2] Haseman describes ‘performative research’ as a ‘multi-method’ mode of research which is ‘led by practice’. This contrasts a purely quantitative or qualitative method.[3] Haseman uses the term *performance* in two ways: work is *performed* both as an action (e.g. work is *carried out*), and also *performed* as an act in front of an audience.[4] All of the works in this thesis were publically shown, and several publically shown in multiple media.[5] *Ant Ballet*, for example, was shown as a documented performance and in multiple different iterations in exhibitions; *Scriptych* was performed in front of a live audience, and a film documenting the performance then shown to new audiences in film festivals. This public exhibition is crucial to my practice; my work represents my attempts to communicate ideas that I believe are important and interesting, and performance through exhibition is central to this communication. Born and Barry’s introduction of *epideixis*, whilst originally targeted towards sic-art projects, is an accurate description of my particular mode of scripted design practice.[6]

In the introduction, I discussed various meanings of the term script. When viewed through the lens of performative research, almost all of these can also be linked to the idea of performance. The root of *scribere* (to scratch) is a gestural movement, and thus an act that must be performed. The behavioural scripting described by Tomkins relies on the performance of *scripts* in order to create affect in humans; in Schank and Abelson’s version of script theory, people perform pre-set roles in scenes they can easily decipher through their common ordering. Computer scripts are performed by computers; reflexive scripted design is performed by a designer. In the projects described by this thesis are numerous performances: computers performed their scripts to an audience in *24fps Psycho*; ants’ reactions to synthetic pheromones unwittingly became a performance in *Ant Ballet*, as did the actions of myself as the projects’ protagonist*;* dancers performed as a computer and with a computer respectively in *Nybble* and *Scriptych*; and so on. There is an inherent connection between the script in its various manifestations, and the need for the script to be performed in some way. In this manner, my work, scripted, performed, and shown to a public, is both Born and Barry’s *epideixis*, as well as a manifestation of Haseman’s notion of *performative research*. This then poses a question: if the performance of design work is to be taken as a mode of research in itself, what then is the role of research in this thesis? How does the research, both in the description of work and methods employed in its creation, relate to the embedded knowledge that is contained in the work itself? And what are the original contributions to knowledge that this thesis claims?

### Reflections on writing

It is tempting when writing accounts of the creation of completed design work to apply a clear, linear narrative to its development. This is what I had been taught to do throughout my entire design education, and commercial work, until doctoral level: after employing a development process that inevitably takes dead-ends, encompasses multiple failures (often themselves the result of an ever-changing ‘design brief’ upon realisation that certain issues cannot be ‘solved’), the designer is to retrospectively apply a rational, concise, and logical account of the design process which presents the final design as inevitable. In my experience, this ‘problem-solving’ mode of design relies on the designer honing the scale of the ‘problem’ they are working with down to one which a technical solution might appear to solve. In the presentation of this thesis, I have consciously avoided such post-rationalisation of my own process, whilst also acknowledging that the premise upon which practice-led research begins is different. Haseman describes practice-led research as beginning not with ‘a problem’ but rather an ‘enthusiasm of practice \[…\] practice-led researchers construct experimental starting points from which practice follows.’[7] One example of such a starting point, Haseman continues, is the availability of a new technology. In chapter 3 of this thesis, the description of APIs, and my understanding of the political ramifications of an increasingly API-focused technology community came via both reading contemporary technology criticism, and from experience testing possibilities of APIs following as own ‘experimental starting point’. My own ‘enthusiasm of practice’ (which might otherwise be informally known variously in different fields as ‘tinkering’, ‘hacking’, or ‘taking apart’) largely served as a starting point for most of the projects within this thesis; as such, the projects do not seek to ‘solve’ a ‘problem’, but rather create a series of objects, performances, films, and installations, which frame critical conversations around technology and the absurd. Often the starting points for the projects would have emerged as a result of an earlier endeavour to learn a new technology or process, although the tracing of such work to a root is sometimes a lengthy process.

One example of this comes in chapter 4 with the production of *Network / Intersect*. The article which inspired ***W***’s character, written by Adrien Chen in the *New York Times*, was initially sent to me by my friend Golo Henseke after I had talked to him about unpublished work I had carried out creating false identities and bots to manage them on Twitter;[8] this work in turn was influenced by presentations I had seen and a workshop I had attended on identity by the artist Heath Bunting.[9] In a similar vein, *86400* was the direct result of learning Python in an attempt to learn about the mechanisms of Google. Although most of the projects described in this thesis (*Scriptych*, *86400*, *24fps Psycho*, and *Network / Intersect*) were developed and exhibited during my residency at the Palais de Tokyo, each of the projects had, in some way, been developed through the research and design work (much of it unpublished) of the preceding few years. The way in which projects develop also relies heavily on formal and informal conversations with numerous people: academic advisors, colleagues, friends, students, and strangers. Where possible, I have attempted to cite as many of these influences, and credit as much of the informal group of people that surrounded each project as possible in the appendix of this thesis.[10]

As well as relying on conversations, the work produced also made use of numerous spaces, and different kinds of spaces, in its research and production. This thesis being produced in an architectural school, the relevance and influence of the spaces its work was created in cannot be underestimated. One of the most striking aspects of Tom Sachs’ practice, as described in the introduction, is the creative freedom evident through the establishment of the studio in which he works; Sachs’ films make it clear that his studio is set up in such a way that it enables productivity and creativity (for instance, in the requirement that all tools must be kept clean and ready for immediate use), is central to the way in which he works, and serves to create and reinforce a culture of practice within the studio. The nature of practice for a relatively unestablished, relatively non-commercial artist such as myself, working in cities such as London and Paris (where all forms of private space are expensive), does not afford such a privilege. I was incredibly fortunate to have been given access to a pair of studios whilst in Paris – one within the Palais de Tokyo itself, and one in the Cité des Arts Internationale (a dedicated artist live-work space) for the period of my residency. Both spaces were set up according to ever-changing needs: for a period, the Palais de Tokyo studio became a film set; at other times both studios had computers whirring away overnight as they ran scripts on thousands of images or film clips; at other times they were quiet places for reading, writing, contemplation, model-making, and so on.

As with the writing of code described in chapter 3, which requires a different mind-set to many other activities, the physical space required to write a thesis is different to the space required to develop design projects. The two activities may be largely intertwined, with various modes of research influencing each other throughout the process, but in this case, they largely occurred in spatial isolation from one another. The writing of this thesis has required a different kind of space: that of the quiet office or library, spatially distinct from the studios used to design, build, film, and test. This thesis has been written in numerous such spaces. I include this detail not because it is important to the narration of the thesis itself, but rather because one of the roles of the thesis itself is to identify elements which have enabled the work described within it to take place, with the hope that this knowledge might later be used to enable similar work or lines of enquiry to be pursued elsewhere.

Until this point, I have examined physical and theoretical context in which the work in this thesis has been produced, but now I will draw attention to its situation within a wider context. The work has been produced both through the design research PhD program and within the artist residency at a national institution; it has been exhibited at a zoo, national art and cultural institutions, at film festivals, and in universities; it has taken in the form of performances, scripts, machines, and installations. Whilst acknowledging to new research paradigms the work sits within, the multidisciplinary nature of the work itself renders traditional artistic categorisation futile; the projects are more united by subject matter and methodology than any singular use of a media. Here I attempt to extrapolate intrinsic properties of the work such the unifying genre may, however problematically, be applied.

In the introduction, and each chapters’ sub-conclusion, I discussed the assessment criteria by which I judge my own work: each projects' use of form, communication, and the absurd in their presentation of a subject. Of the key criteria could be described as *honesty*, which appears in the section on *form* (‘Is the form of this project honest? Does it express the processes and technologies used to create it? Does it formalise its intent in the expression of its form?’). This is consistent rule has manifested itself in all projects. In *Ant Ballet* for example my own internal rules demanded the project had to be *authentic*: that is, depicting the real behaviour of real ants, rather than any sort of simulation. This led to the projects’ main experiment being carried out thousands of miles away in Barcelona (at considerable expense, both in terms of finance and time), rather than the relative ease of the United Kingdom. In *Nybble*, this is manifested as dancers being given instructions via walkie-talkie in real time, in order that they might feel the sensations of being a human computer. In *Scriptych*, the two dancers from the Paris Opera had to spend weeks training to learn how to use devices to measure their movement in space; the two performances in front of a live audience were carried out using the experimental software, rather than a simulated version of this software, even though the potential risks of failure were high – all for the sakes of authenticity. In *Network / Intersect*, the absurd<sub>a</sub> rules of the production meet the shooting of the film far more logistically complex and it might have been otherwise.

The requirement for honesty in this manner draws back to one of my key influences, Stanley Kubrick, whose factual rigour in the production of films such as *Dr. Strangelove* and *2001: A Space Odyssey* add to the joy I get from watching them, and serve to heighten the absurd<sub>a+b</sub> affect the films create.[11] The use of a filmic analogy here is deliberate: it is taken the process of writing of this thesis to realise that film is at the core of what I do. Every project in this thesis has a strong filmic element, and thinking about film early on in each project shapes the form the projects take. Here I would like to discuss the significance of the filmic medium to my work.

### Film

I have been interested in film for as long as I can remember. As discussed in the technical notes to chapter 1 brackets (found in the appendix), I initially began making films at the Bartlett to document machines I was making. This was a natural progression of my interests: in my teens I had inherited my grandfather’s camera collection. I father worked in the photographic industry (and my first job was working in the warehouse of the company he worked for, in part dismantling and repairing industrial photographic equipment). I had access to photographic cameras, unlimited film, and unlimited processing – a luxury in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when the transition from analogue to digital film was barely underway. I spent my summers shooting photos on analogue cameras, and making short films using VHS and DVD cameras. This, combined with technical curiosity, said into a love of both film itself, and film-making. Years later, in joining the Bartlett, making short films seemed to be the most obvious way to document my machine making. Seeing into this practice, I started designing my projects with film in mind. I built simple devices to enable dynamic time lapses of the construction of machines and I was making or trips I was taking.[12] These in turn influenced decisions I would make about the machines themselves: what would be the most effective way of achieving something within my budget, and how would it appear on screen? Both the *Godot Machine* and *Ant Ballet* have clear examples of this in the light rings they utilise above the m utilise above the machines themselves: the lighting acts both as a means of illuminating the devices for video capture, as well as being an homage to the set design of Ken Adams in *Dr. Strangelove*.[13] The films themselves aimed to capture an authentic, working machine being designed, built, and tested.

Since then, all projects have taken their filmic outcome into account early on in the design process, as I am innately aware that any film will be a key outcome of my work itself. With *Scriptych*, for example, the technology used was deliberately hidden from the audiences’ view (the phones strapped to the dancers’ arms were sheathed in black material, and the computer system they were interfacing with was entirely hidden from public view); however, the framing of dancers in space – their position in the room – was based on how they would look on film. When choosing the exact site, they would dance in, I shot test film from every angle I could find in the main entrance atrium of the Opera Garnier, in order to make sure that they would be well-framed in a 16:9 widescreen filming format. I obtained special permission to film the performance with a live audience on the nights of the performance, rather than just film a rehearsal (itself a process requiring negotiations and legal contracts with the Opera for filming rights). The *authenticity* of the film, as a documentation of the event and the process, is not *coincidentally* aesthetically pleasing accident; it is intrinsic to the way in which the project was designed from its inception.

Similarly, in the most obvious example, *Network / Intersect* was a project framed around the creation of the film. The design elements included models of interiors and buildings was forced perspective, all designed to suit is 16:9 format. The angle is the both interior studio and external shots were calculated via 3D diagrams I made, taking measurements of every permutation of camera body and lens within the Palais de Tokyo inventory so that I would know in advance what will be in-shot when we were on location. These lens diagrams were also used to create the special rig for two Black Magic cameras in the Pont Luis Phillipe ***M*** / ***W*** cross-over shot. Much like in the making of *Scriptych*, I also shot test footage in every location that I knew filming might take place in Paris in the weeks leading up to the film’s shooting, both as a means of seeing how the locations would look on film, and in order to work out the mechanics of the film-making itself (how long a shot on an escalator might last, where the camera could move, and so on). The film was designed as much as an object might be, rather than being subject to chance and opportunity.

In my process, the knowledge that something will be or will appear in a film heavily affects its design. Early in most projects are with film in mind. An example of this would be the *Godot Machine* – itself an unfinished project – but one for which I build a 3D model of the machine on a set I designed, then built the set itself in an unused laboratory room within UCL, in order to plan for the eventual tracking shot for a film I wished to make about the machine if it were ever completed.[14] The design of machines (for example, the *Godot Machine*, *Ant Ballet* machine) and performances (e.g. *Nybble*, *Scriptych*) owes a lot to how those machines and performances will look on film.[15]

Another way in which film affects my work is in the creation of projects I categorise as ‘computational curation.’ *86400* and *24fps Psycho* are both projects which used computational technologies to create films through the reinterpretation of archival material (a Google Images search and the Prelinger Archives respectively).[16] In both of these cases, a mode of computational scripting is performed on thousands of images or film clips, reordering and re-presenting them in a new context. The development of computer software to perform these operations was reminiscent of the combinatorics methods discussed in Calvino’s *Cybernetics and Ghosts* (and attempted in his story the *Burning of the Abominable House*), in which a limited number of story-components are recombined in different orders, creating new connections and meanings between the constituent parts.[17] However, the ambitions of *24fps Psycho* went beyond this linear recombination and had intentions of spatializing film, Breaking films down into their constituent components – a series of frames – and finding ways to connect different frames in a virtual space. Although I feel the project to have been ultimately unsuccessful in its current guise, I look forward to developing more refined and computationally capable iterations of this project in the future. I see this work in the vein of Douglas Gordon’s *24 Hour Psycho* and Anthony McCall’s series of ‘solid light’ installations (the most famous of which being *Line Describing a Cone*).[18] Both of these films use the concepts of difference between frames to create and inhabitable space through film projection; Gordon’s 1993 work expanded the film *Psycho* to the extent where the otherwise invisible movement between frames became the works’ focus-point, removing the original meaning from the work, whereas McCall’s work used light and dark areas within a celluloid (and later digital) projection to create moving cones of light for an audience to move through. Both our investigations into the ‘material’ of film, challenging assumptions about the medium itself. this particular line of research, although used to create projects which are formally quite different from my other projects, in fact I derived from a similar starting point of curiosity about the technical make-up of film itself (see chapter 3).

I predict that the role of computational curation will become more prevalent in everyday life in coming years; already, social media, online shopping, and video platforms use aggregated data to recommend content, products, and video based on inferences made through individuals past behaviour and actions online. Emergent technologies hint at the possibility of generating audio and visual content based on textual inputs;[19] a future where films can be generated using combinatorial techniques, with corresponding synthetic visuals and audio, does not seem wildly impractical.

Thinking through making, and specifically, thinking through making films, is not a practice free from restrictions: film is largely codified medium, and thinking about the appearance of every element of a project through two-dimensional rectilinear format that film currently implies may appear to place severe constraints on my work, and the way in which I think about it. However, I would argue that this is in fact fitting for this thesis, as one of its key themes is an emphasis on arbitrary constraints through scripted processes, and the associated creative freedoms these provide. The limitations of thinking and working in a filmic manner are intrinsic to my work itself, by virtue of the way in which I think about work through film, and help to anchor an otherwise largely interdisciplinary practice to at least one form of media.

What then, is the role of this thesis in describing the work that I have produced? The thesis, although descriptive of the methods, influences and processes behind my work, is not a technical manual for recreating the work. Where code is mentioned, it is described, rather than given (this is in part due to the knowledge that any code written in this thesis might be obsolete within a short period of time); I have described the means, context, and reasoning by which projects have been developed, rather than any other mode of presentation. The thesis, then, might itself be interpreted as a script to a working methodology; much like a screenplay enables a director to interpret a story for stage or film, this script might enable other creative practitioners to adopt a process in the creation of their own work. As such, I expect that this thesis might be of interest to critical design practitioners, those interested in film, theatrical or performative production, or those more generally interested in the modes of knowledge production enabled by ‘performative research.’

### Reflections on practice

It is worth noting that none of these projects was developed in isolation from each other: most of the work was carried out in the same studio spaces, using the same computer, with often overlapping production timescales.[20] Yet each mode of scripting carried its own set of parameters, requiring different modes of engagement with subject matter, spaces within studios, and even other people. Practicing the various modes of scripting simultaneously often required jumping from one state of mind to another, in order to pursue contrasting logics and practices, for example, the shift from computational scripting to writing an actual film script. Sometimes I would need to find means to transfer from one mode of scripting to another; often this was in the form of a walk, a meal, or exercise. Some environments were far better suited to different modes of scripting: the isolated studio apartment where I lived in Paris was far better for writing computer code than the sociable studio in the Palais de Tokyo, yet the latter was far better for visual inspiration, creative thinking, and sharing ideas. Understanding the requirements of each mode of scripting informed the way in which work was produced. This is of particular importance today, as computational scripting becomes both and more popular, and more accessible, in architectural design.

The computational aspects of the works mentioned in chapters 2 and 3 required the adoption of a completely different creative mind-set to other parts of the projects. In the second chapter, I have outlined the way in which I attempted to think through the logic of computational code and create instructions, which would effectively generate the desired performance from a computer. Much of this code-writing made use of external libraries (as described by Ousterhout), which meant that lower-level functions could be achieved with rudimentary knowledge of the underlying principles.[21] The machine-learning scripts used to train the word-vectors in *Scriptych*, for example, were based on a library called Gensim by Radim Řehůřek, which enabled the parsing of large corpora of words to create word-vectors for every word which appeared in a collection of Hollywood film scripts, themselves having been downloaded via automated scripts and processed by Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil at Cornell University.[22] Gensim is open-source, and is maintained by Řehůřek and myriad other volunteers; it was programmed in Python, itself an open-source programming framework with thousands of contributors, and it makes extensive use of Tomas Mikolov et al’s Word2vec process.[23] The interface that enabled dancers’ moves to retrieve these words was built in Max, a visual scripting language, but also made extensive use of libraries which enabled it to communicate with the sensors via Open Sound Control, as well as an instance of Gensim running in Python, and the ‘say’ functions within Mac OS X’s built-in command line interface. I could continue to cite various libraries, snippets of code, dependencies, interfaces, and languages for each project (including several more for *Scriptych*), but this thesis is about design research, not computer science. In short, using computer scripting languages enables the integration of myriad external libraries which extend the core functionality of a language, making repetitive or difficult tasks easier, or simply speeding up the production process (as described by Ousterhout).[24]

Although many of the libraries for languages such as Python are open-source, and freely distributed, there is a cost to the ease with which they can be used. This is borne in both ignorance over functionality, whereby the end user does not have to know what the computer is really doing when a certain instance is called, and the risk of creating software that is overly dependent on external libraries. Many libraries are in fact reliant on other, lower-level libraries for their core functionality; a library such as *pyMovie* is actually a fancy wrapper for *ffmpeg*, for example. Simultaneously, the high level of dependency that operates within these languages can act as an Achilles' heel: the deprecation of Google's Image Search API during the execution of *86400*'s image-gathering procedure highlighted how the lack of support for one particular library, API, or even language can have a major impact on the reliability of an artwork. Even the software which ran *Scriptych*, developed only last year, requires a very specific software and hardware setup, and is at risk of not working simply through routine software updates on the smartphones or laptop it runs on (the computer used to produce the work, and this thesis, has auto-updated its operating system tens of times since then). This is partly due to the low-budget nature of such software development: experimental projects such as this one are a form of electronic *bricolage*, relying on off-the-shelf hardware and software patched together via untested means. Whilst other artefacts (such as films, buildings, costumes, and books) are all at risk of various forms of degradation, none quite match the fragility of this type of computer-based work of art.[25] Attempts to rectify these vulnerabilities and archive software tend to focus on the concept of a virtual machine, a software emulation of specific hardware and operating systems, a necessity which generally prohibits physical archiving and interaction.[26] The remedy to such issues might be a step towards more robust, lower-level programming on my behalf– but this takes considerable time and effort to learn, and, as I will explain shortly, such practice comes at a cost.

Writing computer code, in my experience, requires a different mode of engagement to other modes of design practice. Whereas physical design, with pencil and paper, can be completed in a loud studio (perhaps with music playing), in a conversational manner, the writing of code of any complexity often requires its author to engage in intense concentration as they iteratively build layers of complexity into an extremely abstract system. In my experience, this is also intensely antisocial, and my physical studio requirements differ if I am building a model for a film, or writing a programme, which interfaces with an online service. Often I have found myself the only person in any given place working on a code-based project (as was the case in Opera Garnier with *Scriptych*, or whilst working in Nanji in Seoul on *24fps Psycho*). This creates a different atmosphere to the traditional design studio, a place which relies on a high level of interaction between its inhabitants in order to enable the cross-pollination of ideas. Where I have found traditional design logic is best explored through testing it with other people – both as design ideas are formed and often fleshed out in a convivial manner, and asking the opinion of colleagues (or anyone else) – often my code is written in isolation, and the support communities exist purely online, in the form of websites, wikis, and forums.

Much of my non-code design practice contains references to other work (for example, the repeated references to Stanley Kubrick’s films in the *Godot Machine* and *Ant Ballet*, or to Beckett in *Nybble*), or a moment of humour (for example, the posters reminding the viewer they are ‘in Korea’ in *Network / Intersect*). I try to maintain this ethos whilst writing code, embedding humour or references into the very functionality of the project.[27] I am aware that in most cases this will never be seen: the work I produce is generally too embedded in artistic practice to be of interest to many programmers, and that sort of detail is too technical to be of interest to most of my peers in the design, art, or architecture worlds.[28]

Computer programmers and scripters alike often refer to a state of working they call ‘flow’ – a total immersion in work whereby everything outside of the task in hand becomes unimportant and abstract.[29] I have experienced this state whilst working on numerous design projects, but never to the same extent as whilst working with computer scripting. There is something about working on extremely technical issues, which requires a thought process quite different from normal, everyday logic. This causes me to lose myself in my work, which I find immensely enjoyable.[30] Similarly, the highly technical nature of computer scripting has a draw for a particular *type* of person within the field of architecture. As Peg Rawes notes, although there is a near-even ratio of female to male students within US/UK architecture schools, code-based architectural design (such as Parametricism) is: ‘more commonly populated by male students who are instructed through intensive workshops which focus on repetition and emulation.’[31] Whilst this is problematic within the world of architecture, it is perhaps manifest most explicitly in the remarkably male-dominated workplaces of Silicon Valley. As recent news reports have shown, there is increasing discontent with the aggressive corporate culture perpetuated within Silicon Valley technology companies (in particular Uber).[32] Chapter 3 of this thesis discussed one instance where the idealised, quasi-mathematical model of continual movement has been translated into a daily reality for a swathe of Uber’s drivers, who are now the test-subjects in what the company is calling the *Perpetual Trip*.[33] Much of the aggressive nature of the technology industry is arguably perpetuated by the mythology surrounding the Valley’s start-up scene: the image of young (usually male) entrepreneurs frantically building circuit boards, writing code, and using venture capital to create the “next big thing” in a garage is synonymous with Silicon Valley’s corporate technological culture.[34]

The notion of a mythological origin story is not only found in Silicon Valley technologists. As was mentioned in the introduction, Rawes has argued that the ‘hot house’ methods in which Parametricism is taught within universities, small teams, and ‘labs’ has generated a discourse around the style that relinquishes designer agency and equates computation-based design with ‘natural’ processes.[35] Rawes claims that latter is reinforced by mythologised connections between code and highly selective slices of genetic theory (such as D’Arcy Wentworth Thompson’s *On Growth and Form*) drawing parallels between Parametricism and organic, nonhuman processes.[36] As a result, this ‘uncritical belief in computational emergence’ Rawes argues, ‘reduces diverse organic life to a self-same matter’.[37] This argument has parallels with Korzybski’s map-territory relation (as invoked by Bateson), discussed in chapter 1:[38] claiming that an organic system can be explained through a mathematical model (as is the case with many of the morphological arguments in *On Growth* *and Form*) is akin to producing a map of a territory; it necessarily requires a process of reduction and exclusion. Using that same map, or parametric model, to then plan territory renders the territory itself subject to the same process of reduction and exclusion. In the case of Parametricism, human behaviour and desires are often reduced to a simple agent-based model, which reduces human desire to the status of movement through space.[39] Rawes proposes a renewed interest in Spinoza’s notion of geometric and ecological ratios as a means of ensuring human wellbeing and environmental responsibility; I will shortly discuss how I believe Tomkins’ notion of psychological scripting may also offer a means of a more humane mode of architectural practice. Computational scripting does not have to exist in isolation, or as a non-critical discipline within architectural design. The projects presented in this thesis show the ability to use computational scripting to pose critical questions about contemporary technology, as also demonstrated by artists such as James Bridle, Kasia Molga, Heath Bunting, and institutions such as Het Nieuwe Instituut in the Netherlands.

### Contribution to knowledge

Perhaps the most salient question of a theses’ conclusion is what the author sees as their original contribution to knowledge. Besides the performed research of the design work itself, this thesis contains three original contributions to knowledge. This first is both technical and absurd<sub>a</sub>: the novel interface mechanism described in *Scriptych* (chapter 2). This original system allows the retrieval of data, and the creation of highly specific three-dimensional vectors, via sequences of movements. The rotational angles of an arm in three axes are converted to vectors via a ‘move’, and moves can be strung together, enabling a nine-fold increase in the accuracy of a vector with each additional move. The method of data retrieval is thus performative in the way it encourages a person to interact with the system; it effectively spatially embeds the user within a database, requiring the user to learn how to *think* *within*, rather than simply use, the system. It requires a space around the person that is free from obstacles, and places absurdly high expectations on both the memory, and accuracy of movement of the user. It is not a system designed for real-world use, but rather, in the spirit of this thesis, an absurd, performative mechanism which places its user into a machine.

The second, and arguably main, contribution to knowledge, is reflexive scripted design, as described in chapter 4. This is a novel methodology which was initially tested with the development of the film *Network / Intersect*. It is also somewhat absurd<sub>a</sub>, and relies on a designer to engage with multiple modes of research in order to gain a deep knowledge of a subject area, then use that knowledge to design a set of rules (also known as a script). This script is then performed back into a work that thy produce, with each decision that is made in the production of that work being run via the script. The process is made explicit in chapter 4, but in reality, elements of this process have been used implicitly in every other project in this thesis. In the introduction, I introduced some assessment criteria by which I assess my own work; this is itself a primitive, implicit ruleset (or script).

This script can first be seen in more detail in *Ant Ballet*; before producing the machinery, costumes, and paraphernalia that made their way into the experimental performance and film, I engaged in a lengthy process of research, producing only tentative designs. The rules I followed about *authenticity* (i.e. that I was only interested in documenting real results) placed severe restrictions on the physical locations that the experiments could be carried out within; the legal restriction on importing ants to the UK, and the resulting absurd<sub>a</sub> journey to the forests surrounding Barcelona became an intrinsic part of the work, as the design research transformed into performance. This was aided by my tendency to film much of the process, and the resulting ‘documentary’ film became as central to the project’s description as the technology behind the work itself.[40] The project by following my own self-imposed rules, became an absurd performance. Reflexive scripted design combines two or more literary sources, a location, and a scripted ruleset; *Ant Ballet* might then be seen to be a work derived from synthesis of contemporary scientific literature regarding ants and network systems, Stanley Kubrick’s *Dr. Strangelove*, in the context of a journey to a forest near Barcelona.

Since *Ant Ballet*, each project has implicitly used elements of the reflexive scripted design, placing rules on a projects’ development based on a period of research into multiple influences, the synthesis of these influences into a ruleset, and the locating of the resultant design work in a time and place. *Nybble* gave dancers rules based on the experiences of Italo Calvino, Alan Turing, and banks of ‘human computers’ of the past; this was synthesised with the mechanical workings of contemporary computers (in particular the parsing of ASCII characters to a screen) in the context of the V&A courtyard. *Scriptych* synthesised contemporary computing theory, in the form of vector space embedding of language, with constrained writing techniques inspired by the Oulipo, in the context of Opera Garnier. Dancers had to follow rules, as did the projects’ creators, Simon Valastro and I: the project aspired to authenticity, and as such, we placed extreme constraints on the way in which it was carried out. *86400* and *24fps Psycho* are minor anomalies in this trend – but both projects made extensive use of scripting in their creation. *Network / Intersect* was the first project to use reflexive scripted design explicitly, codifying the methodology that had already been a part of my methodology since the early 2010s.

In this context, I propose the reflexive scripted design methodology as this thesis’ main contribution to knowledge: designed intuitively through the process of design projects over the past few years, it represents exactly the kind of knowledge creation Haseman advocates in his ‘Manifesto for Performative Research’.[41]

This thesis’ third contribution to knowledge is the use of the particular synthesis of scripting and the absurd that I have used to critically question technology. I hope that this has served to open up the use of the term ‘script’ within design as both a creatively generative, and critical tool.[42]

### Notes on practice: opportunities for future research

This study has examined several key areas related to script, the absurd, diagrams and performance from the perspective of a designer and artist working in performative architectural design and film-making. This is, by virtue of the research methodology, a limiting practice. No one person can reasonably expect to tackle all issues that they might wish to. Whilst this thesis has provided accounts of my own research-based methodology, there are several areas, which I have not yet been able to explore which I believe may yield fruitful research in the future.

The first is the relationship between psychological scripting, affect, and architecture, with the theories of Silvan Tomkins of particular interest. To what extent can architecture influence the way in which Tomkinsian scripts form, develop and are enacted; and what could this tell us about how to improve design for human inhabitation, and how might this play out in film? Whilst ‘behavioural scripting’ is a term already in use within parametricist discourse, it generally refers to programming highly reductive ‘agents’ in a virtual environment to simulate their movement (rather than emotions), most commonly whilst in a crowd. A study into Tomkinsian psychological scripting and affect may yield interesting methods for designing better, more humane environments, which are enjoyable to inhabit.[43] One possible case study (which I mentioned briefly in the footnotes to the introduction chapter) could be *Hogeweyk* in the Netherlands, a care community for dementia sufferers (designed by Dementia Village Architects: Frank van Dillen and Michael Bol).[44] The community is designed to have the appearance of a generic town, with amenities such as shop, theatre, pub, and public square, with residents carrying out apparently normal lives within the town. It is, in effect, a safe place, offering residents a good deal more autonomy than residents than a traditional care home. One of the significant problems that dementia suffers commonly face is the confrontation with the realisation that they are being looked after, and mistrust that occurs when, for example, staff who they do not recognise have to coerce them into taking medication. *Hogeweyk* operates to a different principle: staff do not wear uniforms, but rather clothes that imply they are just ordinary citizens in the town; the residents are able to go about their lives in a manner whereby they can continue what might be described as *scripted* behaviour, buying groceries at the shop, visiting the pub or restaurant, all the while being cared for by the staff (who find themselves playing generic ‘roles’). The carers do not contradict the reality the residents project onto their situation unless explicitly asked; thus, the residents are able to be cared for in a way that minimises conflict, and associated stress and mistrust.[45]

The second area for future research is the viability of the reflexive scripted design process, both for its current intended media of fictional film and theatre, as well as for other modes of design. So far, I have made one film using this practice, but its robust viability is unproved in any medium beyond this. How might reflexive scripted design be applied to other modes of practice, such as design of the built environment or graphics? Is it only suitable for work that deals with fiction? These, and more questions, are as yet unanswered.

The final area of research that I believe to be interesting is precisely the one I intend to work on next: better defining the relationship between the psychological script, human agency, and various models of freedom. As explained in this thesis’ introduction, human agency, and the extent to which behaviour can be codified and predicted, is one of the central questions of large-scale surveillance systems – themselves often operated by ‘agencies’ of the state. These immense prediction systems, also the product of myriad machine learning computer scripts, rely on inferences about human behaviour based on the ‘logic of resemblance.’[46] The systems are constructed on the assumption that with enough data, patterns of threatening or subversive behaviour will reveal themselves through a similarity to previous instances of such behaviour – i.e. that such behaviour is, itself, somehow subject to a script. The relationship between this mode of behavioural analysis with the intention of prediction, as well as the often-opaque mechanisms through which it often operates, and the concepts of psychological scripting advocated by Tomkins / Schank and Abelson, is largely unexplored. What’s more, the evolving nature of the predictive systems, and the way in which they codify and predict human behaviour contain potential implications for the three types of freedom – personal, sovereign, and civic freedom – identified by historical sociologist Orlando Patterson.[47] This is a subject area which I have hinted at but not explicitly explored, throughout this thesis, one in which I believe the topic of the absurd<sub>b</sub> may once again prove to be a useful ally.

[10] The mode of citing influences in academic research is notably different from the way that teams are credited in commercial design practice. If performative research is to develop further as a discourse in academia, this is an area which needs to be addressed.

[12] My favourite low-tech trick was to place a time-lapse camera on a rotating egg-timer into a busy studio where a large object was being build, resulting in a dynamically rotating, frenetic time-lapse.

[13] The use of white LEDs over other available light was due to the fact they would not interfere with video like Tungsten, fluorescent tubes, or halogen lights might.

[14] The film was planned to begin with the machine from afar, in a darkened room, lit only by the light of its ‘halo’ light; in one long, unbroken dolly-controlled shot it would pan all the way to an extreme close-up of them at walking on the machines’ surface. The construction of the set also involved construction of a dolly-device.

[15] This is probably further shaped by my background in graphics and product design, in which I developed a love of graphic forms and grid structures of Josef Müller-Brockman, Massimo Vignelli, and Dieter Rams (whose machine interface designs strongly influenced the design of the *Godot Machine* computer). Most of the three-dimensional devices I make are, in fact, designed as a series of two-dimensional planes; machines make repeated use of laser- or water-cut sheet metals, which are then folded into three-dimensional forms.

[16] I use the term ‘archival’ for Google images, as the search engines’ repository and database of images is continuously updated; the searches that I performed in the creation of *86400* represent a snapshot of Google Images as an archive at that particular moment in its history.

Virtual machines are also now a core concept to services such as Docker, Amazon Elastic Web Compute, and Google Compute Engine, all of which now offer ‘cloud-based’ computing services which distribute computation to large-scale distributed computer servers.

[29] The term ‘flow’ was coined by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, following research into the creative process with Jacob W. Getzels in the 1960s. Csikszentmihalyi was ‘struck by the fact that when work on a painting was going well, the artist persisted single-mindedly, disregarding hunger, fatigue, and discomfort—yet rapidly lost interest in the artistic creation once it had been completed.’ Such a description could be applied to the state of mind I find myself in whilst programming.
