-   Conclusion notes

-   *Evaluate synergy between projects and research/theory in thesis; how both contribute to new knowledge.* (Note: come back to chapter 1’s mention of epidexis ‘the art of showing in front, in the presence of a public, to make a show’; (quote early on: *As a form of epideixis, public experiments do not so much present existing scientific knowledge to the public, as forge relations between new knowledge, things, locations and persons that did not exist before – in this way producing truth, public, and their relation at the same time*).

    -   This comes back to the primary aims of this thesis. What is it for? Mention that in a way, the past four years have been spent designing a methodology through which to present practice.

-   *Examine context in which research lies: it is not architectural design!* It is at the intersection of film and design; each project has a filmic element; each film is designed. The underlying similarity between the disparate projects is the mode in which they have been carried out: all to an extent follow the Reflexive Scripted Design process, whereby after a period of research, a series of rules are set (explicitly or implicitly). One consistent rule is the authenticity: with Ant Ballet, this led to the project taking place in Spain; with Nybble, the dancers really did not know the meaning of what they were doing; with Scriptych, the performance had to use live computation. In the film-making world this might be interpreted in two ways. Firstly, one could argue that the films’ role is documentary; they are documenting a process, even if the manner in which they document does not follow the standard narrative of documentary. This therefore makes the work itself a performance. This is definitely true of all of the projects! Ant Ballet required performance (it could have just shown the ants following the trails sans-costume); Nybble and Scriptych were explicitly performance, although I was not the performer; 86400 occupies the space of performance in the way it feels, as when the film is played in real time it has the feeling of fleetingness, that each moment will be lost forever; 24fps Psycho was performative computing (and the stress involved was definitely that of a performance!); Network/Intersect could be seen as a performance which resulted in a film (challenging even my personal relationships with the actors, crew, etc). So in a sense this mode of practice is performative, and temporal. This is the field of Tom Sachs’ films; the quest for authenticity of performance, the taking on of the belief that one’s actions and belief at time of executing an action are important.

    -   The second aspect of this authenticity could be seen more in the context of my earlier writing about sci-art, Kubrick, but lies more in the world of film-making. K was meticulous in his research; consulting experts in every possible field. This is well-documented; but so are film-makers like Christopher Nolan, whose blockbuster films famously feature as many in-camera special effects as possible. This is a murky area: the films are by no means documentaries, but the audience is sold on the notion of this authenticity. This is similar to the idea of character acting; Daniel Day Lewis in There Will be Blood, or Marlon Brando, or Robert DeNiro in Raging Bull. This idea of authenticity is common in Hollywood (an industry notorious for its insincerity). Perhaps Nolan’s work is a back-lash against CGI (although makes heavy use of it). But more than that it is about empathy. Because one watches a film that has been created using in camera effects, and marvels at the audacity of it; one empathises with the actors, suspended from a cable, and thinks what it must have been like to be that actor, the set spinning all around. In knowing the effect is an effect, but a *real* one, we’re more willing to believe it. such is the case with my work: the aim is to produce absurd things, but to make them believable, relatable, authentic. In this respect the work is in a lineage of film.

    -   So that doesn’t completely place the work. It is between design and film. It is in the space of both; it borrows methodologies from both. i see the future of my work in the world of film – although not always bounded to the confines of a screen. Will discuss more in next section…perhaps it’s better to ask what this work can be seen as contributing to the world of film and the world of design.

-   *The role of film in the development of projects; how the work provides an original contribution to film today.*

    -   Film is a central component to the projects ive presented here. All of them have a filmic outcome (besides Godot). Clearly many of the influences I mentioned in the introduction and through the chapters are film-makers (Sachs, Kaufman, Kubrick) \*FN there is also an interest in literary and theatrical work which displays similar properties (Calvino, ToA)\*.

    -   Film plays an active role in the design process. *Ant Ballet* was the first project to really do this. I knew the best way to convey an idea such as this was via film, and it can be seen as prototypical for the way in which I use film now. All other projects (besides Gdt) are designed with film in mind from early on.

    -   This is important, but perhaps it’s also restrictive. Thinking through film perhaps a symptom of modern paradigm. There is a scene in Herzog’s cave of forgotten dreams where cave paintings are shown on top of each other, two (?) animals. The paintings are notable because of the lack of rectilinear bounding that they convey; to my eyes, which see grids everywhere, they are unbounded, their surfaces aren’t flat, it is impossible for me to conceive of how the authors could have painted them. Thinking in films shapes the work I do; there is an invisible film-camera frame that each object I design sits within. I try to deconstruct film, but in case of 24fps psycho it then becomes film.

    -   But this is the way that I work. I am content with that. My work is definitely in the film world. Film itself is a medium that was largely commercially-fixed; it’s an entertainment medium, a storytelling medium. It is fuelled by, and demands changes in, technology. Cameras get smaller, better resolution, etc. at the same time, formats become more formulaic (all films shot / presented in similar formats). Witness for example the recent rise of the vlog, the daily video log, which acts as a way for people to document their lives, or at least aspects of them, online. Although only a few years old, there are now standard conventions, topics, etc. one thing that’s positive about my work is that it is consistent in method, rather than medium. The films presented are diverse in subject, etc. (Maybe this is a silly point? Probably.)

-   *How the work produced in this thesis through live practice and the original concept of ‘scripting’ contributes to the field of practice-led research in general. *
